# Startup Information Extraction from PDF Pitch Decks

## 📋 Quick Summary

This project extracts **startup names** and **founder names** from PDF pitch decks stored in Google Drive and saves them to a CSV file.

**Key Advantage**: No file monitoring needed - process all PDFs at once with a single command!

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Get your Google Drive folder ID from the URL
# https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID_HERE

# 3. Run the extractor
python batch_startup_extractor.py YOUR_FOLDER_ID
```

**Output**: CSV file in your temp folder with all startup and founder information ✅

## ✨ What You Get

### The Main Script
- **File**: `batch_startup_extractor.py` (NEW)
- **What it does**: Processes all PDFs in a Google Drive folder
- **Output**: CSV with file_name, startup_name, founders, extraction_method

### Two-Stage Extraction
1. **Stage 1: Rule-Based** (Fast, Free)
   - Pattern matching for "Founders:" sections
   - Name extraction from document
   - ~1 second per PDF

2. **Stage 2: Gemini API** (Accurate, Optional)
   - Uses AI for complex documents

## 💡 How It Works

```
Google Drive Folder
        ↓
   Find all PDFs
        ↓
   For each PDF:
        ├─ Download file
        ├─ Extract text (Vision API)
        ├─ Try rule-based extraction
        │   ├─ Success? → Save to CSV
        │   └─ Failed? → Try Gemini
        ├─ Gemini extraction (if enabled)
        │   └─ Save to CSV
        └─ Handle errors gracefully
        ↓
   Write CSV file
        ↓
   Done! ✅
```

## 📊 Performance

| Scenario | Time | Cost |
|----------|------|------|
| 10 PDFs (rules-based) | ~5-10 min | Vision API only |
| 10 PDFs (with Gemini) | ~10-15 min | Vision API + ~$0.001 |
| 100 PDFs (rules-based) | ~50-100 min | Vision API only |
| 100 PDFs (with Gemini) | ~100-150 min | Vision API + ~$0.01 |

---

## 🐛 Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| 0 PDFs found | Share folder with service account email |
| ModuleNotFoundError | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Empty founders list | Use `--gemini` flag |
| Permission denied | Use `--output` to custom location |

See [BATCH_EXTRACTOR_GUIDE.md](BATCH_EXTRACTOR_GUIDE.md#troubleshooting) for more details.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this replace the original PDF summarization?**  
A: No! The original `process_pdf_summary()` function is completely unchanged.

**Q: Do I need Gemini API key?**  
A: No! Rules-based extraction works fine without it. Gemini is optional.

**Q: How much does this cost?**  
A: Only Vision API (already being used). Gemini fallback costs ~$0.0001 per PDF.

**Q: Can I run this with 100+ PDFs?**  
A: Yes! But it will take time. Consider running in batches.

**Q: Is my data sent to external services?**  
A: Text only sent to Gemini if `--gemini` flag is used. Otherwise, only Vision API.
