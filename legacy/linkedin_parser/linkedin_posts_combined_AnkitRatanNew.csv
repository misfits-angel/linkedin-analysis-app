For the last few months, we‚Äôve been working on building something truly exciting, and today, it‚Äôs finally live! ‚ö°Ô∏è

Introducing the Fintech Premier League (FPL) - a first-of-its-kind CXO cricket league bringing together 32 of India‚Äôs leading fintechs on one field to celebrate collaboration, competition, and camaraderie.

This has been one of the most fun and meaningful projects I‚Äôve worked on, seeing founders, CXOs, and teams from across the ecosystem come together not just to play but to connect and build lasting relationships beyond business.

FPL will be played across NCR, Mumbai, and Bangalore, with regional rounds, finals, and a national championship that promises to be as dynamic and spirited as the fintech ecosystem itself.

üèè Here‚Äôs to strategy, teamwork, and a healthy dose of rivalry, all in the name of community and sport.
Couldn‚Äôt be more thrilled to officially launch the season alongside all 32 incredible team captains!

üí¨ If you‚Äôre curious about the league, partnerships, or want to be part of the action ‚Äî reach out to me. The Fintech Premier League has just begun, and trust me, it‚Äôs going to be unforgettable.

I‚Äôve been reviewing a lot of PRDs recently, and I‚Äôve noticed something worrying.
Some product managers are now using GPT to drive their thinking instead of support it.
The result? Documents that check every box of a PRD template‚Ä¶ but are full of confusion. To a junior PM, it looks polished. To an experienced eye, it‚Äôs mostly noise.

To be clear: GPT is extremely powerful. We use it daily. But like any power tool, the outcome depends on the craftsperson. When GPT leads, it can produce confident structure without correct substance‚Äîand that‚Äôs hard to detect if you‚Äôre early in your career.

Where GPT shines
-Evidence gathering: pull prior art, benchmarks, and user quotes.
-Synthesis: compress interviews/notes into themes and edge cases.
-Exploration: generate alternative framings, risks, and test scenarios.
-Communication: first drafts of release notes, FAQs, checklists.

What you should not outsource
-Problem definition: who is the user, what‚Äôs the job, what hurts now.
-Context + constraints: compliance, data realities, org priorities.
-Prioritization and trade-offs: what we will not build and why.
Decision ownership: success metrics, guardrails, and accountability.

A simple review test I use
Few sentence problem (no AI): if you can‚Äôt state it cleanly, you‚Äôre not ready to draft.
Evidence trace: every user scenario ties to a source or observation.
Decisions > templates: I look for rationale, not headings.

GPT should amplify your clarity, not simulate it. If the first time you feel ‚Äúclear‚Äù is after the AI draft, that‚Äôs a warning sign.
To young professionals (PMs and beyond): master the thinking, then use GPT to accelerate it. Tools compound good judgment; they can‚Äôt replace it.

But there‚Äôs another side to my life ‚Äî much quieter, but just as meaningful.
For the past few years, my family ( Moni Gupta, Aloka Kumar Kulshrestha) has been running an initiative called Seva Setu. It‚Äôs not a startup. There‚Äôs no pitch deck. No VC funding. Just a simple mission: serve those who are often overlooked ‚Äî children from underserved communities, the elderly in care homes, even animals in need.
This past year, Seva Setu has supported students with study kits, helped children access daily nutritious meals, enabled access to quality education, cared for elders, and looked after cows in gaushalas.
It‚Äôs not loud work, but worth it.
Whenever the intensity of building Signzy feels overwhelming, Seva Setu reminds me of a different kind of impact - one measured not in product metrics or scale, but in human moments. 
We‚Äôve put together a short annual report to capture some of what we‚Äôve been able to do this year. If you‚Äôd like to take a look or just know more, here it is: Seva_Setu_Annual_Report_2024-25

A recent debate has reignited this foundational AI question.

It started with an Apple research paper that argued today‚Äôs AI systems‚Äîincluding large language models‚Äîare not truly ‚Äúreasoning.‚Äù They‚Äôre just doing statistical pattern matching at scale. No abstraction, no understanding, no causality‚Äîjust very good autocomplete.

In response, Ilya Sutskever (co-founder of OpenAI) delivered a lecture where he flipped the script:

> ‚ÄúOur brains are also just giant pattern matchers.‚Äù



His point? Intelligence doesn‚Äôt require symbolic logic or explicit reasoning steps. The human brain learns from patterns too‚Äîassociations, reinforcement, feedback. And LLMs are perhaps walking the same evolutionary path, just digitally.

But here‚Äôs a missing piece that neither side emphasizes enough:
The substrate matters.

üß† Human brains are massively parallel, analog, and energy efficient. Neurons can fire with infinite gradations, and billions of them operate simultaneously. Pattern matching in the brain can involve emotional nuance, parallel thoughts, and contextual awareness‚Äîall happening together.

üíª AI systems, on the other hand, run on silicon chips. Even with GPUs and TPUs, they‚Äôre fundamentally linear, digital, and binary. A transistor can be ON or OFF. Parallelism is simulated, and multitasking is expensive. When an LLM generates a sentence, it's not juggling multiple perspectives in the way a human does‚Äîit‚Äôs walking one path at a time, very fast.

So yes, maybe both brains and LLMs are pattern matchers.
But only one of them is doing it in wetware, with organic nuance and infinite resolution. The other is stuck in silicon.

And perhaps, that difference still matters more than we think.",38,2,0,4mo,Post,Ankit Ratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan,2025-06-27T10:37:00.000Z,,2025-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,,2025-06-27

Spoke more about this in my recent article for Elets Banking and Finance  (linked in the first comment)
Two pivotal points that jumped out:
-Ten years ago, a cross-border onboarding flow took days and a war room of analysts. Today, a well-trained model can clear a customer in under five minutes and still spot the deepfake hiding behind a doctored passport photo.
-Also, this shift isn‚Äôt only about speed; it‚Äôs about who gets to build. When rules can be codified and updated in software, compliance moves from a cost centre to a product feature. Suddenly regional banks, credit unions, even niche fintech apps can launch globally without blowing up their risk budget.

EPAA‚Äôs report does a great job capturing the momentum in India‚Äôs digital payments landscape‚Äînot just trends, but the real energy shaping the future.

I had the chance to share a small perspective on something I care deeply about: how trust, compliance, and regtech are evolving in our region. As payments become faster and more seamless, the invisible infrastructure of identity and fraud prevention becomes even more important.

At Signzy, we‚Äôve been quietly working behind the scenes to build that infrastructure‚Äîhelping banks and fintechs onboard customers with trust, speed, and security. It‚Äôs encouraging to see these conversations gaining more attention.

Thank you to Monica Jasuja and Camilla Bullock at EPA for the thoughtful dialogue and for including Signzy as one of the voices from India.

A few striking numbers from the report:

Digital payment transaction volumes have grown 573x between 2005 and 2024.

The number of banks live on UPI has grown from 21 in 2016 to 661 in 2025.

There‚Äôs a lot of buzz around new AI frameworks like MCP and A2A, and many people are asking ‚Äî how are these different from traditional APIs?

Let‚Äôs break it down with simple examples:
1. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
 APIs are how different apps talk to each other ‚Äî especially when they‚Äôre owned by different teams or companies.
Example:
 Your app wants to check the credit score of a user. You hit an external credit bureau‚Äôs API, which returns a score.
 The bureau decides what data to expose, how often, and in what format.
APIs are great for external world integration ‚Äî clean, secure, versioned. But they require agreement, documentation, and often strict access control.
 You don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs behind the curtain ‚Äî you just use what‚Äôs offered.

2. MCP (Model-Context Protocol)
 Introduced by Anthropic, MCP allows LLMs to interact with external tools and data via a standardized interface. It‚Äôs still a one-model world, but you feed it structured access to plugins and databases.
Example:
 An LLM helping a customer support agent might use MCP to look up order history, check return status, or send a refund ‚Äî all through tools connected via this common protocol.
MCP is about making a single AI model smarter by giving it controlled access to context and tools.
 It reduces the need to hard-code every integration.

3. A2A (Agent-to-Agent Framework)
 This is where things shift from integration to collaboration. With A2A, different AI agents can talk to each other, negotiate, and complete tasks together ‚Äî even across systems ‚Äî without needing formal APIs exposed.
Example:
A lightweight agent on your app checks user inputs
It passes the data to a document-verifying agent
That agent flags inconsistencies and triggers a risk-check agent
All this happens internally, without each system exposing APIs or standardizing requests
It‚Äôs like RPA ‚Äî but no humans in the loop, and far more intelligence.

The Big Shift
API: You tell me what you expose, and I‚Äôll write code to use it.
MCP: I‚Äôm one smart AI, and I know how to use tools if you give me handles.
A2A: I‚Äôm part of a team of smart agents. We‚Äôll talk, figure it out, and get the job done ‚Äî no need to call IT to expose a new API.

This opens up exciting new possibilities:
-Teams don‚Äôt have to standardize every backend operation into an API
-On-device agents can handle more on the edge
-Internal workflows become more autonomous and scalable

The AI architecture of the future won‚Äôt be a single genius model ‚Äî it‚Äôll be a team of capable agents talking to each other.
Let me know what you think ‚Äî or if you‚Äôve started playing with these ideas. Would love to hear more use cases.",117,20,5,6mo,Post,Ankit Ratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan,2025-04-28T10:37:00.000Z,,2025-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,,2025-04-28

It‚Äôs a framework where different AI agents can talk to each other, work together, and check each other‚Äôs work.
Instead of one big model doing everything, A2A lets multiple smaller agents handle different tasks ‚Äî like writing code, reviewing it, and deciding what to do next. Kind of like how real teams operate.
What‚Äôs exciting here is that this is not just about breaking one prompt into parts (like MCP does). In MCP, you're still driving one model to do multiple tasks in a structured way ‚Äî like giving it a checklist. But with A2A, you're creating actual independent agents, each focused on their own specialty, talking and collaborating like co-workers. It‚Äôs a more modular, flexible setup.
Another interesting angle: A2A could enable lightweight agents on the edge (like inside your mobile app) to talk to more powerful agents running on the backend. That could mean faster responses, less data transfer, and better privacy ‚Äî especially useful in customer-facing apps.
In the customer onboarding space, this opens up a lot. You often need:
One agent to recommend the right financial product
Another to verify documents and extract data
A third to assess customer risk
With A2A, these specialized agents can be trained once and reused across different workflows ‚Äî no need to build new agents or clunky rule-switching logic every time something changes.
We‚Äôre exploring how this could help improve our own onboarding and document automation flows. Early days, but it feels like a solid step toward building smarter, more adaptable AI systems.",113,9,2,6mo,Post,Ankit Ratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan,2025-04-28T10:37:00.000Z,,2025-04-10T00:00:00.000Z,,2025-04-28

Union Minister Piyush Goyal recent remarks at Startup Mahakumbh‚Äîmentioning ‚Äúfancy ice creams‚Äù and ‚Äúhyperfast groceries‚Äù‚Äîsparked strong reactions across India‚Äôs startup world.

But perhaps the criticism should be seen less as dismissal and more as deliberate tough love. Goyal, one of India‚Äôs most effective communicators, likely chose his words to provoke reflection‚Äînot discourage innovation. Like a parent urging a child to aim higher, his message is clear: India must prioritize deep tech innovation if it wants to lead globally.

While consumption-driven startups have created jobs, attracted FDI, and modernized services, they often reorganize existing spending patterns rather than build long-term capability. True nation-changing innovation‚Äîsemiconductors, robotics, EVs, AI‚Äîrequires patient investment, research, and ecosystem-wide support.

Countries like South Korea (electronics), Israel (cybersecurity), and China (EVs & automation) made deliberate, long-term bets on deep tech‚Äîand are reaping the benefits.

The responsibility doesn‚Äôt lie with founders alone. Government, academia, investors, and corporate leaders must work in concert. That means more public funding for research, deeper academia-industry collaboration, and a culture that celebrates solving hard problems‚Äînot just scaling fast.

India doesn‚Äôt need to abandon consumer innovation. But we must balance it with bold, future-defining bets. The next chapter of our startup story should be about building the technology the world uses‚Äînot just delivering it faster.

If this speech makes us pause and ask: What kind of innovation will define India in 2047?, then it has served its purpose.

Remember the days when splitting a bill meant long calculations, awkward reminders, and the dreaded ""I'll pay you later"" texts? Apps like Splitwise thrived because paying back was a pain‚Äîlogging into a bank on a desktop, adding payees, and waiting for transfers to process.
Then came UPI in India‚Äîand overnight, bill-splitting apps became almost‚Ä¶ irrelevant. üíÄ
üìä UPI Revolution in Numbers:
 ‚úÖ 8.9 billion transactions in April 2024 üöÄ
 ‚úÖ 85%+ market share dominated by PhonePe & Google Pay
 ‚úÖ Instant, 24/7 transfers with no need for third-party apps
Now, you just scan, pay, and move on‚Äîno need to ""split later"" when you can pay instantly. Apps like PhonePe and Google Pay even offer built-in bill-splitting features.
Meanwhile, in the US‚Ä¶ üá∫üá∏
 Without a widely adopted real-time payment system like UPI, apps like Splitwise, Venmo, and SettleUp still thrive. People track expenses, send Venmo requests, and wait for money to land in their bank accounts.
üí° Lesson?
 Tech adoption isn‚Äôt just about innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs about removing friction. India leapfrogged the bill-splitting era by making payments instant, while the US still leans on dedicated apps.

As more people in India turn to digital wallets, banks are seeing a decline in low-cost deposits like CASA. This has created a gap between credit and deposit growth rates.

To tackle this, Banks need to rethink their approach by adopting digital wallet features and integrating them into their offerings to attract and retain customers. This could be a key strategy to address the issue of declining low-cost deposits.

Banks can integrate pass-through wallets, in which funds are pulled directly from savings accounts for seamless transactions. 

This innovative approach will enable banks to meet the personalized needs of their customers, offering them the benefit of seamless transactions.

Regulations are essential for protecting consumers, ensuring market integrity, and fostering an environment conducive to innovation.

I believe RBI is taking a proactive stance by adopting a collaborative approach, actively engaging with industry stakeholders to refine the regulatory landscape. This effort not only emphasizes the importance of rules but also encourages innovation within the sector.

However, navigating the complex web of regulatory requirements can be daunting for fintech companies. Here, AI and machine learning solutions can play a pivotal role by providing timely alerts, mitigating the risk of fines and penalties, and preventing legal disputes.

The RBI has issued a draft guideline aimed at bolstering the security and reliability of the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS). This initiative addresses recent fraud instances by enhancing the due diligence process for AePS touchpoint operators, akin to the scrutiny other merchants undergo. Key highlights include:

üîπ Comprehensive due diligence during the onboarding of AePS touchpoint operators, aligned with KYC guidelines.
üîπ Mandatory KYC updates for operators inactive for over six months.
üîπ Ensuring each operator is onboarded by only one acquiring bank.
üîπ Continuous monitoring and setting transaction limits based on the operator's risk profile and operational location.

This move not only fortifies the system against fraud but also aligns AePS touchpoint operators with the stringent standards applied to other merchants.

At Signzy, we're ready to support this transition. Our advanced fraud transaction monitoring solution ensures seamless KYC updates and real-time surveillance, helping financial institutions stay compliant and secure.

Stay ahead with security and compliance! üí™

The FinTech ecosystem seeks a ‚ÄúGrowth-Friendly‚Äù environment:

1. Regulatory clarity to ease business operations and attract investment.
2. Lower TDS rates and access to capital to boost funding.
3. Government support to facilitate partnerships with traditional financial institutions.
4. Expanding FinTech services to underserved MSMEs

According to me the biggest back pain for India‚Äôs MSMEs is the massive credit gap of $530 billion, with only 14% of the 51 million MSMEs accessing formal credit, compared to 50% in the US and 37% in China. 

Traditional credit assessment methods severely disadvantage them due to small loan sizes and lack of documentation.

To effectively address this gap, we expect the finance minister to significantly strengthen digital infrastructure and financial literacy programs, focusing on government-backed credit schemes. 

Promoting AI-powered credit assessments will drastically improve lending decisions, while automating loan processes through AI tools will build essential trust between lenders and MSMEs. 

These measures will not only bridge the credit gap but also propel India toward its goal of becoming a $7 trillion economy by equipping MSMEs with critical business resources

But the landscape is changing dramatically. 

Customers are increasingly opting for higher-yielding investments like fixed deposits and mutual funds. 

‚Üí Fixed deposits offer attractive rates of 5% to 7.85% for a one-year tenure.
‚Üí Mutual funds provide even higher returns, averaging 12% to 14% for a one-year period.

This shift is forcing banks to rethink their strategies and find new ways to fund their operations.

The 2 main challenges they face are:

1. Rising Cost of Funds: As customers move away from savings accounts, banks face higher costs to acquire funds.

{The cost of deposits has surged from 3.72% in Q1FY23 to 5.09% in Q4FY24}

2. NIM Pressure: The increasing gap between deposit rates and lending rates is squeezing banks' net interest margins.

To navigate these challenges, banks must focus on:

‚Üí Leveraging AI and automation to reduce operational costs and enhance customer experience.
‚Üí Exploring alternative funding options beyond traditional deposits.
‚ÜíIdentifying new revenue streams through value-added services and premium offerings.


The banking industry is watching the upcoming Union Budget closely for potential relief, such as tax breaks on interest income. 

The changing dynamics of the deposit market underscore the need for banks to adapt their business models and embrace innovation.

But a significant roadblock to their growth is a massive credit gap - a staggering $530 billion. 

Traditional loan approval processes can be slow and cumbersome, especially for smaller businesses.

AI-powered credit assessment APIs will help here.

These tools leverage data analysis to streamline the loan assessment process for lenders. 

This means faster decisions and a more comprehensive understanding of a business's creditworthiness.

For MSMEs, it can mean:

1. Faster Funding: AI can analyze a business's financial health quickly, reducing the time it takes to secure a loan. 

2. Data-Driven Decisions: AI can go beyond traditional paperwork and analyze a wider range of data points, like a business's transaction history and growth potential. 

3. Level Playing Field: By relying on data and AI, smaller businesses can compete for loans based on their actual potential, not just mountains of paperwork.

AI in lending isn't just about efficiency ‚Äì it's about inclusivity.

 It provides a pathway for MSMEs to access the resources they need to thrive. 

This, in turn, strengthens the overall Indian economy.

Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations are the most common offenses.

Here is the breakdown from an Economic Times piece I contributed to:

‚Üí Total Penalty Haul: ‚Çπ78.6 crore collected in the last three years.
‚Üí Penalty Frequency: 261 penalties imposed in 2023 alone!
‚Üí Top Offenders: Urban and rural co-operative banks, responsible for ‚Çπ13.5 crore and ‚Çπ20.13 crore in fines respectively (from 2021 to January 2024).

There are two main reasons for the surge in penalties:

1. Stricter Audits: The RBI has intensified its audits, particularly focusing on fintech companies and non-banking financial institutions (NBFCs).

2. KYC/AML Shortcomings: Many institutions, especially smaller ones like co-operative banks and fintech startups, lack the resources or expertise to properly implement KYC and AML procedures. These procedures are crucial for preventing money laundering activities.

What does this mean for Fintechs?

We are known for our innovative approach, but might not always have robust risk management and compliance teams like traditional banks. 

This can lead to practices that don't align with RBI regulations. 

Financial institutions, regardless of size or approach, I urge you to prioritise KYC and AML compliance. 

The RBI is serious about enforcing these regulations, and non-compliance can lead to hefty fines.

Acc. to me it‚Äôs AI Loans.

India has its sights set on becoming a $7 trillion economy by 2030, and small businesses ‚Äì the lifeblood of any economy ‚Äì need a boost to get us there.

The United States, for instance, leaned heavily on its small businesses when it became a $7 trillion economy. 

Nearly half of their economic growth came from these smaller players! 

India's small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) have that same potential, but they're facing a hurdle: access to loans.

Traditionally, getting a loan as a small business can be a frustrating process filled with mountains of paperwork and sky-high interest rates. 

This is because banks often rely on methods that are slow and may not fully capture a business's true potential.

Here's where AI can help by analysing all the information quickly to help banks get a much clearer picture of a small business's potential, potentially leading to faster loan approvals and more favourable interest rates for MSMEs.

What makes AI-powered loan approvals so powerful is:
‚Üí Faster Decisions
‚Üí Reduced Errors
‚Üí A More Holistic View

With AI as their ally, MSMEs can finally unlock their full potential for growth. 

This translates to more jobs, a stronger economy, and India taking that crucial flight path to becoming a $7 trillion powerhouse.

After incorporating feedback from industry, the final framework, known as the SRO-FT framework, was finalised on 30th May.

Key points of the finalised SRO-FT framework include:

1. The SRO-FT framework is designed to be adaptive and proportional to the dynamic nature of the FinTech landscape, addressing concerns such as customer protection, data privacy, cyber security, grievance handling, internal governance, and financial system integrity.

2. Entities meeting the eligibility criteria outlined in the framework are invited to submit their applications for SRO recognition, with the RBI evaluating these applications and publishing the names of recognized SROs on its official website.

3. The framework emphasises a balanced oversight mechanism that encourages self-regulation while striking a judicious balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks in the FinTech sector.

Overall, this framework is a big step towards a more responsible and trustworthy FinTech industry in India. 

It empowers FinTech companies to take charge of their own growth while following high standards. 

This can only lead to a more secure and exciting future for FinTech in our country!

These will be instrumental in streamlining regulatory processes, facilitating retail investment, and bolstering transparency in the fintech landscape.

1. PRAVAAH Portal

This online platform streamlines the application process for regulatory approvals, licenses, and authorizations from the RBI. 

It will improve efficiency and reduce processing times.

2. RBI Retail Direct App

This mobile application empowers retail investors to directly buy and sell government securities (G-Secs) on their smartphones. 

This move aims to democratise access to the bond market, allowing easier participation in primary and secondary market transactions.

3. FinTech Repository

This comprehensive data repository will offer information on fintech firms, their activities, and technology adoption within regulated institutions. 

This initiative is expected to enhance regulatory understanding and policy formulation.

These steps, yet again, position the RBI as a proactive steward, paving the way for a more secure and flourishing financial future for India.

Over 37 crore customers used AePS transactions in 2023.

However, concerns have emerged regarding security risks.

Fraudsters have exploited the lack of two-factor authentication via unauthorised withdrawals using cloned fingerprints.

The National Payments Corporation of India's (NPCI) recent guidelines for Acquiring Member Banks (AMBs) onboarding merchants for BHIM Aadhaar Pay (BAP) directly address the RBI's focus on security.

By requiring stricter onboarding processes for touchpoint operators, these guidelines could help mitigate the risk of fraud. 

The core of these guidelines involves:

1. Strong due diligence for merchants

AMBs are responsible for verifying merchant identities, business nature, and adherence to regulations like the Aadhaar Act 2016.

2. Risk-based classifications

They need to classify merchants into risk categories and prohibited categories include illegal activities and unregulated financial products.

3. Continuous monitoring

Keep track of suspicious activity, verify online merchant websites, and prevent cash withdrawal transactions through BAP.

This ensures responsible growth of BAP while maintaining a secure and trustworthy digital payments environment.

I‚Äôve attached the official guidelines here, feel free to spread the word.

But RBI‚Äôs stricter KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations, while necessary for security, can create operational headaches.

They can burden fintech startups with complex manual processes as traditional KYC methods are slow, error-prone, and hinder user experience.

And if PAs don't adapt there's a risk of falling behind on compliance and growth.

Here's where AI-powered RegTech solutions can be helpful, they offer:

‚Üí Automated onboarding
‚Üí Faster e-KYC (electronic KYC)
‚Üí Real-time transaction monitoring

These tools streamline verification, improve fraud detection, and ensure efficient regulatory compliance.

As the fintech industry in India undergoes regulatory changes, payment aggregators face a strong need of enhancing KYC practices.

The RBI acknowledges this and is committed to the fintech sector‚Äôs growth:

1. They've extended the Payments Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) scheme to December 2025
2. Multiple KYC methods (Aadhaar KYC, GST, e-Sign) provide PAs with flexibility to choose the right verification approach.

Enhanced KYC isn't just about meeting regulations; it's about growth. 

In my article for ETBFSI, I describe how PAs can shape the future of India's digital economy by embracing RegTech. (It‚Äôs linked in the comments)

Fraudsters are getting smarter, employing sophisticated methods like deepfakes to steal identities and exploit the vast amount of data available online. 

This poses a major challenge for financial institutions (FIs) trying to balance digitalization with security.

It sometimes feels easier to abandon digitalization.

But that‚Äôs not the answer.

The key is to implement proactive strategies to reduce fraud while maintaining seamless access to financial services for legitimate customers.

Here's how:

1. FIs can leverage AI, data analytics, and machine learning to detect and prevent fraud more effectively than ever.

2. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and AI-powered threat intelligence can make security significantly more secure.

3. By regularly training and educating employees and customers, everyone can be empowered to identify and mitigate threats.

4. By implementing ‚ÄúGuardian AI‚Äù, you get antivirus protection along with continuous AI monitoring. Additionally, it analyses vast datasets for suspicious activity in transactions and user behaviour.

The framework requires loan aggregators to provide a digital view showcasing all available loan offers based on the borrower's needs. 

This view must be unbiased and avoid promoting specific lenders. 

Additionally, it must include key details like:

‚Üí Lender names (Regulated Entities - REs)
‚Üí Loan amount and repayment period (tenor)
‚Üí Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for cost comparison
‚Üí Links to each lender's Key Facts Statement (KFS) with detailed information

This framework has benefits for Borrowers and Lenders, both:

Borrowers:
‚Üí They can easily compare offers and select the one that best suits their financial situation.

Lenders:
‚Üí The framework fosters a fairer competitive landscape based on competitive rates, not hidden fees.

Today, many loan aggregators work with multiple lenders, leaving borrowers unsure of who they might be matched with initially. 

This lack of upfront information often leads to hidden costs buried deep in loan agreements, making comparison difficult.

This framework is a powerful step for a smarter borrowing experience.

Three days ago, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued guidelines to strengthen regulations for Payment Aggregators (PAs).

These directions cover the following key points:

1. Data storage: From August 2025, only card issuers and networks can store card transaction data. Others must delete all stored data and can only keep the last four digits and issuer name for tracking purposes.

These moves significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and protect consumers' financial information.

2. Net worth requirements: Non-bank PA-Ps need a minimum net worth of Rs 15 crore to apply for authorization and Rs 25 crore by March 2028. Non-compliant existing PA-Ps must cease operations by July 2025 or their bank accounts will be closed by October 2025.

This not only protects consumers but also fosters a level playing field within the industry.

3. Authorization: PA-P companies need to inform the RBI within 60 days if they want to seek authorization. Existing players must apply by May 2025.

4. Merchant monitoring: PAs must continuously monitor merchants' transactions, emphasise stricter merchant onboarding procedures, set risk-based payment limits, and identify potential risks early.

In my opinion, such clear guidelines only boost the PA ecosystem, promote ethical practices, and ultimately enhance digital trust.

It is a positive step towards improving transparency and consumer protection in the Indian loan market.

It highlights 4 important themes:

1. Increased transparency in loan terms for borrowers
2. Easier comparison of loan offers from different lenders
3. Empowers borrowers to make informed financial decisions
4. Reduced information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders

It mandates that Regular Entities (REs) provide a standardised Key Facts Statement (KFS) to borrowers, which will include:

1. Important information about the loan, such as the interest rate, fees, and APR. 

This will make it easier for borrowers to understand the true cost of the loan and compare different offers from different lenders.

2. The circular requires that the KFS be written in a language that the borrower understands. 

This will help to ensure that borrowers are not disadvantaged by a lack of financial literacy.

This is yet another welcoming step by the RBI because it empowers borrowers, fostering a more responsible and inclusive lending environment in India.

It was an interesting discussion with Abhishek Arun, Rajat Deshpande, Rohit Taneja, and Sheshanth Bhambore about how Indian SAAS companies are revolutionising the fintech landscape.

We discussed how Indian SaaS solutions are driving growth by:

1. Enhancing accessibility: 

Bridging the gap for the underbanked population through mobile solutions and digital payments.

2. Streamlining processes: 

Cloud-based SaaS platforms making financial services faster, more efficient, and cost-effective.

3. Personalising experiences: 

AI and data analytics are being leveraged to provide tailored financial products and services.

Indeed, the Indian SaaS companies hold the potential to revolutionise not just the domestic market, but the global fintech scene as well.

{India boasts the world's highest Fintech adoption rate at 87%, surpassing the global average of 64%.}

Historically, India has relied heavily on oral traditions (such as Shruti) for knowledge transfer.

This meant that knowledge, wisdom, and cultural values were passed down through generations via spoken word rather than through written texts. 

As a nation, we need a structured effort towards:

1. Identifying and Prioritise Our Data Sources:
A national task force should be created¬†to identify key indigenous data sources, including historical texts, cultural artefacts, traditional knowledge systems, linguistic diversity, and behavioural patterns.

2. Digitization and Structuring of Data:
To digitise and structure indigenous data, academic institutions, libraries, and cultural organisations should collaborate actively.

3. Conversion into Machine-Readable Formats:
Use OCR to convert analog sources into digital formats.

4. Data Annotation and Enrichment:
Utilise linguists, historians, and subject matter experts for annotating and enriching the digitised data.

5. Development of Indian NLP Models:
Establish research partnerships between academic institutions, industry, and government agencies to develop NLP models trained on multilingual Indian corpora.

6. Constant Community Feedback:
Gather feedback from local communities, practitioners, and policymakers to ensure the solutions align with the preferences of diverse communities. 

While documentation may not have been our forte, we have a rich diversity of experiences waiting to be digitised.

The rise of data platforms like Databricks who are powering Ola‚Äôs Krutrim is a positive sign. 

This collaboration not only underscores our capability but also signals a shift towards leveraging indigenous data for innovation.

Here‚Äôs what I mean: 

On one hand, it is responsible for safeguarding consumers and maintaining financial stability. 

On the other hand, it also needs to embrace new technologies to foster innovation.

With regards to the same, I published an article for ETBFSI, discussing how the recent RBI's decisions can be both right and wrong simultaneously.

The RBI, as India's central banking authority, shoulders immense responsibility in steering the country's economic course. 

Its decisions resound across sectors, impacting businesses, consumers, and investors alike. 

However, the effectiveness of its policies isn't always straightforward.

While certain measures may align with broader economic objectives, they might inadvertently hinder growth or overlook sector-specific nuances. 

Recognizing this complexity is essential for stakeholders navigating India's financial landscape.

Additionally, a well-calibrated regulatory framework can achieve both objectives - ensuring consumer protection without stifling the growth of new financial products and services.

I discuss more about this in detail in my article (link pinned in the comments).

According to a report, there has been a significant 10x increase in the number of deepfakes detected globally across all industries from 2022 to 2023. 

There were notable regional differences with deepfake surges in North America (1740%), APAC (1530%), Europe (780%), MEA (450%) and Latin America (410%).

Even prominent figures like Ratan Tata, Sachin Tendulkar, Narayan Murthy, Priyanka Chopra, Alia Bhatt, Virat Kohli, etc haven't been spared and were the victims of deepfake videos. 

Fraudsters are creating deepfake videos to impersonate celebrities and trick people into investing money.

This alarming trend not only raises questions about privacy and digital security but also about the potential misuse of such technology. 

We must implement robust cybersecurity measures like biometrics and multiple authentication methods as well as advocate for stricter regulations to combat this growing threat.

This raises two important questions:

1. Should we broaden the scope of ""systemically important institutions"" (D-SIBs)?

Currently, only a few large banks are classified as D-SIBs by the RBI. 

However, the PPB case highlights how even smaller entities can pose systemic risks if they falter. 

Experts suggest expanding the D-SIB framework to include:

‚Üí Payments banks: Their critical role in the financial ecosystem necessitates closer scrutiny.

‚Üí Fintech companies: Their dominance in payments, especially foreign players like PhonePe and Google Pay, raises concerns about potential instability.

‚Üí Other key players: Entities like the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and account aggregators (AAs) might also warrant inclusion.

2. Should we consider an activity-based approach to risk assessment?

The current system focuses on the size and interconnectedness of institutions. 

Experts propose a shift to an ""activity-based"" model that evaluates the inherent risks of specific activities, like payment processing, regardless of the entity performing them.

Further considerations:

‚Üí Pricing of UPI: The debate around free UPI transactions continues. While it benefits consumers, it raises concerns about the sustainability of the system and the potential dominance of foreign players.

‚Üí KYC compliance: The Paytm episode underscores the importance of strict KYC norms for all financial entities, including fintech companies.

We believe finding a balance between innovation and regulation is crucial for the healthy development of the Indian financial ecosystem.

Madhu Srinivas and Sivaram Jayaraman are one-of-a-kind, they are trained to be risk averse but still took the risk to start a venture, making them a rare find in the ecosystem.

So, what does this mean for financial institutions?

FIs now get access to a wider range of RegTech solutions from a single provider. 

This can help them to streamline their compliance processes and reduce costs.

FYI - Difenz was able to take one of our common customers live within just 2 weeks on their transaction monitoring tool, for anyone who understands monitoring this is lightning fast.

As India embraces digital transactions, the issue of Know Your Customer (KYC) updation fraud continues to pose a significant threat. 

Recently, the RBI issued an advisory highlighting the ongoing vulnerability of individuals to these malicious practices. 

Despite repeated warnings, many still fall prey to these tactics, resulting in financial losses and emotional distress.

Here's how to protect yourself from cyber fraud:

1) Never share sensitive info: Personal information, login details, card information, PINs, passwords, or OTPs with anyone, especially through unverified channels.

2) Be cautious: Only update KYC through official bank channels or their verified mobile apps. Contact your bank directly for confirmation if unsure.

3) Stay informed: Follow official bank/RBI channels for updates and warnings about fraudulent activities.

4) Report immediately: If you suspect fraud, inform your bank and file a complaint on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal.

Remember, legitimate institutions will never ask for confidential details through unverified channels.

I discuss more on this in detail in the latest article by CyberSee (link pinned in the comments).

Regulatory Technology (RegTech) provides a variety of tools and technologies that can help businesses in protecting themselves and their customers.

It offers:

‚Üí Security features
‚Üí Fraud monitoring
‚Üí Risk management
‚Üí Suspicious activity identification

Signzy, for example, uses AI, ML, and video KYC to verify identities and documents. 

This helps to prevent fraud and protect user data.

A new set of regulations has been adopted by the Government of India, and RegTech can assist businesses in complying with them:

‚Üí DPDPA 2023 (Data Protection and Privacy Development Act 2023): This legislation focuses on data protection and privacy, aligning with international standards. It mandates businesses to adopt ethical data practices and enhance online authentication measures to ensure compliance.

‚Üí Telecommunications Act 2023: This act extends regulatory oversight to communication channels like Gmail, WhatsApp, and Slack, in addition to traditional phone calls and SMSs. It emphasises robust authentication processes to prevent misuse and privacy violations.

‚Üí RBI's KYC Amendments in Master Directions: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced changes in its master directions regarding Know Your Customer (KYC) norms. These amendments aim to boost security measures, particularly in the BFSI sector, by enhancing online authentication measures and data protection protocols.

Lastly, RegTech is also aiding businesses in staying ahead of emerging cyber threats like AI-enhanced phishing attacks and SIM swapping.

Thereby holding the potential to make the digital world a safer place for everyone.

I discussed more on this topic in my interview with IBS Intelligence (link is pinned in the comments).

While deepfakes have the potential to be used for entertainment purposes, they also pose a serious threat to our sense of identity and security. 

They can be used to spread misinformation, damage reputations, and even commit fraud.

I sat down with StartupTalky, to discuss the growing problem of deepfakes and how we can protect ourselves from them. 

I am bullish about one promising solution that is V-KYC (video-based Know Your Customer), a technology that can be used to verify someone's identity in real-time. 

V-KYC uses facial recognition and other biometric data to ensure that the person in the video is who they claim to be.

While V-KYC is a powerful tool, it is important to use it responsibly. 

Companies that use V-KYC must prioritise data security and obtain user consent before collecting and using biometric data.

In addition to V-KYC, we as a society need to be critical of the information we consume and share online.

The fight against deepfakes is an ongoing one and we need to protect our identities to ensure that the digital world remains a safe and trustworthy place.

GIFT City offers multiple benefits for seasoned investors ‚Äì high return potential, strategic location, SEZ benefits, world-class infrastructure, business-friendly policies, diverse investment opportunities, talented workforce, robust connectivity, IFSC status, and regulated environment. 

Recently the industry met with the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA). 

{ FYI -¬† IFSCA's primary responsibility is to regulate financial services activities in the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) at GIFT City in Gujarat, India. 

IFSC is the single regulator in GIFT, so it matches the size of Hong Kong or London, and it has the potential to become the biggest regulator in the world. }

The meet-up highlighted some key points:

1) Harmonisation of Regulatory Bodies: 

The need for continued harmonisation between different regulatory bodies was discussed. Its impact is visible in GIFT City, where regulators, industry players, and fintechs all work under one roof. 

2) Compliance as an Opportunity: 

Businesses that view compliance as an opportunity can gain a competitive edge. Technological solutions, such as those provided by Signzy, make navigating complex regulations easier, fostering trust and transparency.

3) Technology is at the Heart of the Ecosystem: 

Tech advancements are transforming the way compliance is managed and will continue to do so. 

The development of GIFT City is a milestone achievement, showcasing that ease of doing business is possible in India and our fintech journey is scaling to new heights.

The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought not just innovative chatbots but also opened doors to sophisticated scams. 

The latest victim of deep fake video is Taylor Swift (my wife was quite appalled when she found out, considering she is her favourite and role model)

Scammers are weaponizing the LLM's uncanny ability to mimic human language, craft hyper-personalised phishing emails, impersonate CEOs, and even generate fake news at scale.

However, understanding the psychology behind these scams is important.

Deepfakes exploit our inherent trust in familiar faces and voices, triggering emotional responses that bypass critical thinking. 

This, coupled with our cognitive biases, makes us vulnerable to scams like never before.

We at Signzy have been following this rise closely.

Scammers exploited human emotions in a similar way to what happened during the pandemic:

 Victims were asked to transfer Rs 11 via UPI, with the promise that the money would be deposited into the Ram Mandir bank account. 

They were told that the prasad is sponsored by a Union Minister.

 Fake tour packages to Ayodhya offering the booking of the first-day pooja were widely circulated.

The young generation, often confused about what‚Äôs next, thinks MBA is the only answer.

Then comes the race to land an internship which, some win and some lose.

Reading about the recent placement failure got me thinking: 

Is MBA still relevant? 

The traditional MBA curriculum is primarily focused on finance and marketing.

Earlier MBA meant better jobs, better compensation, a prestigious network, and a predictable future. 


Fast forward to today, automation and attribution are the core capabilities that fill your pockets and lead to a sustainable career graph. 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already eliminated 25% of job profiles.

Moreover, are we really equipping the students with the necessary skills to thrive in today's dynamic landscape?

Only recently in November 2023, GMAT Focus Edition 2023 was introduced that targets to focus on skills relevant for business school. 

Next comes the summer internship conundrum. 

Companies are facing a hiring freeze, making it increasingly difficult to offer pre-placement offers (PPOs); the holy grail of summer internships. 

This isn't just about referring to the big names in India. 

It is about the broader context of employment opportunities in India. 

Yes, they are at an all-time high, but the nature of work is changing. 

Maybe the ""MBA = success"" equation needs a rewrite.

Whereas for me, I believe Tech giants are ahead in tech, and if they get licensed now, they will win.

But as the ecosystem is maturing, tech is becoming easier to adopt for banks and it will eventually become a fair playing field for banks. Since banks' ability to judge risk is better, they have a higher chance to win.

Once again, thank you, The Economic Times for making me a part of this panel.

He interacted with us, understanding and appreciating the solution we offered - Remote Digital Current Account Opening for SMEs.

He was so humble and kind with his words that even in our short duration of interaction, I never felt once that I was conversing with a political leader. 

Another highlight of the fest was the Global FinTech Hackcelerator and FinTech Awards.

Where we became one of the finalists for two categories namely the MAS Fintech Award and the ABS Global FinTech Award at SFF 2017 for our solution.

While my child doesn‚Äôt play video games yet, I am still afraid the moment she starts fiddling with my phone. Many of my friends with older children worry about their Internet or social media usage. Still, most parents don‚Äôt realise that a much darker underworld hides inside many popular online or #mobilegames that children play. 

Most multi-user games have in-built chat features that let players to chat or send messages to each other. And Internet and news media is full of horror stories of how children or teens are bullied or harassed by other gamers or even targeted by adult predators through chat messages. 

As parents, nothing is scarier than the thought of having your child fall victim to these online bullies or predators. And yet, we as parents can do nothing other than denying our children access to mobile devices or computers, which is simply impractical in this day and age. 

The onus is clearly on the gaming industry to do more to safeguard our children. Ensuring full #KYC for all users is an important first step and this is what I talk about in my piece, published in The Times Of India earlier this week.

While the fight may or maynot happen but this Childish (or well orchestrated PR) move is in very bad taste.

It gives a message that physical prowess is the ultimate ability. And superiority should be achieved through violence vs dialogue.

 Wont it be much better if they challenged each other to a televised debate. 

While I am sure they are just having fun but they fail to acknowledge the weight they carry as leaders, who millions of kids look up to.

 In a world which is already seeing Putin use violence to resolve conflict , it further distances dialogue  as an effective means to solutions.

Through sheer determination and hard work, we were successful in winning the trust of many customers. And now, we're onto bigger things and expanding to new geographies.

Recently, we sponsored the ICBA Live event in Hawaii, where we continue to hustle just like we did in India. I was even carrying my baby in my hands while speaking to a potential customer at the Signzy booth. We could have been partying on these beautiful islands, but our mission keeps us awake to work even in the nights! 

We learned that each bank is unique and that we must work together to address their unique challenges. We're excited to partner with ICBA to empower community banks in the US and the communities they serve.

Looking forward to connecting with more community banks and solving their day-to-day problems. Let's work together to revolutionize the banking experience!

Our team had the pleasure of interacting with forward-thinking #creditunion and thought leaders who are looking to revolutionize the industry. We've received fantastic feedback from credit unions on how our digital onboarding infrastructure can transform the way they verify and onboard customers. This was our first sponsored event and boy did it open our eyes to the immense problem CUs and Smaller #Banks face. 

A big shout out to our partner Scienaptic AI for partnering with us to revolutionize commercial lending. Our seamless workflow integrates identity verification and underwriting checks, creating a more efficient and secure process for both credit unions and their customers.

Excited to continue expanding Signzy's #AI based innovative approach to digital onboarding and solving various use cases through it for the US Market. 

P.S. - Signzy will be attending more events in March
#icba Live in Hawaii from 12 to 15 March &
