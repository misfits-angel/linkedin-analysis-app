Think again. 

This isn't about e-commerce anymore. It’s about the creation of a new, terrifyingly effective Data Flywheel.

See, for two decades, the game was simple:
- Amazon owned purchase data.
- Google owned intent data.

They captured the ""what"" and the ""when.""

OpenAI’s integration with Etsy (and soon, 1M+ Shopify merchants via Stripe) captures the ‘why.’ The entire conversational journey, from a vague desire (""gift for my eco-conscious friend"") to a direct purchase, happens in one place.

This is a masterclass in category design. By owning the full context - the category (discovery), the customer (conversation), and the competition (by bypassing them), OpenAI is creating an ‘unfair advantage.’

This rich, conversational data is the ultimate fuel. It allows their AI to not just serve customers, but to anticipate the next categories worth creating. And by open-sourcing the protocol with Stripe, they’re inviting everyone to help build their moat. (Classic category move).

Founders: Are you just building a product, or are you consciously designing the product, the company, AND the category simultaneously?

Because RuPay on UPI isn't just killing cash. It's reinventing credit.

The first wave of Indian credit cards targeted your mind. The new wave is targeting your muscle memory.

The old model was about big rewards on infrequent purchases like flights. It required convincing users to take on debt.

The new UPI-RuPay wave is different. It's about embedding credit into small, daily habits - your groceries, your rickshaw ride, your roadside chai sutta break.

This is ""Behavior Drives Attitude"" in action.

By integrating with the 9.4 billion UPI scans happening monthly, players like Cred are not trying to change how you *think* about credit.

They are changing how you *act* at checkout.

With RuPay’s availability on UPI, it’s market share has moved from 3% in 2023 to 16% in 2025. BTW, nearly half of these transactions occurred through UPI, highlighting the shift to frequent, small-value payments.

When credit is the most convenient, rewarding option on a familiar QR code, behavior shifts first. The attitude follows.

The lesson for founders is clear. The fastest way to build a habit is to find an existing one and remove friction. Don't invent a new behavior.

Everyone's asking how incumbent SaaS startups can compete in the AI era. I think they're asking the wrong question.

The real question isn't ""how do they beat them?""
It's ""can they even survive the onslaught of AI-native startups?""

You can't bolt an AI engine onto a 10-year-old operating model and expect to win. The company's DNA is wrong. 

The very things that made them successful are now liabilities.
Their ""disciplined"" processes don't allow for experimentation AI requires.
Their growth needs are too big for the nascent markets where disruption starts.
Their best and the most profitable customers would be the last to want the new thing.

This is the classic innovator's dilemma, supercharged.

The smartest defense can be to refuse to play a losing game.
Cede the old market. Migrate your unique assets—brand trust, distribution, capital, proprietary data—to a new battleground  and play the AI native game.

Very few have executed this well. But the ones who do, win big.

1. Intercom: A legacy SaaS player in customer support. Instead of just adding a chatbot, they went all-in on a new, AI-native product (Fin AI). They leveraged their existing brand and customer base to launch it. Result? On track to cross $100M ARR.

2. Replit: Born as an online coding platform, they could have been left behind. Instead, they went all-in on AI. Using their massive community of 10M+ developers, they gave people superpowers to build and launch software instantly. This pivot help them reach a $3B+ valuation with real traction.

Investors & board members: Are you advising your legacy SaaS startups to win a new game or lose the old one? The choice isn't adapt or die. It's transform or die.

This is THE 'uncomfortable question' that separates a status quo investor from the ones who truly understand this AI wave!

Folks, what’s worked (or failed) when you’ve seen incumbents try to change the game? I would love honest stories.",13,3,0,1mo,Post,Vishal Jain,https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xvishalj,https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xvishalj/,2025-10-08T11:59:09.525Z,,2025-09-05T05:10:11.039Z,,,,
https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369263497974579200,,Text,"""Go big or go home"" is the fastest way to founder burnout.

Jensen Huang said it himself on a recent podcast: he didn't build NVIDIA on that mantra. He built it on a foundation of ""very low expectations.""

Not grand vision. Not ""think bigger.""
Grounded, operational resilience.

Our ecosystem obsesses over the grand vision on day 1. But the founders who actually change the game master a critical duality:

1. An outsider's audacious vision for the future.
2. An operator's extremely grounded expectation for the present (the biggest differentiator in my mind)

The grand vision is the 'why'. It attracts capital and talent.
The low expectations are the 'how'. Which gives strength for the daily grind.

We celebrate Musk's vision for SpaceX but ignore the grounded expectation of failure that fueled each of his iteration.

In India, we see Urban Company's upcoming grand IPO, but often overlook the years of grueling, operational grind to train and standardize thousands of service partners, expecting nothing but problems to solve daily. UC founders didn't discuss the grand IPO every day. They focused on solving problem with very low expectation from their next step...

Your ambition is for the destination.
But your expectations must be for the very next step.

This is the balance that prevents burnout while protecting the dream.

And it's the uncomfortable truth most founders aren't willing to accept.

I came across an interesting tidbit yesterday — Jack Dorsey’s first line of code at Square wasn’t for payments.

It was for an internal admin dashboard. A tool built for a product that didn't even have users yet.

This wasn’t about building a feature. It was about building the company’s central nervous system, a lesson learned directly from Twitter's chaotic early days.

An organization's greatest capabilities often become its greatest disabilities. The processes that get you to your first 100 customers can prevent you from reaching 1 million.

Dorsey chose to install a foundational discipline first: log, measure, and test everything. He built the system for learning before there was anything to learn from.

It’s a powerful reframe.
You aren’t just building a product.
You’re building the organization that builds the product.

By the way, we recently invested in an F&V quick commerce startup. One key reason was their internal product - its finesse would make any designer proud. This signaled to us that product quality is deeply embedded in their DNA.

So, the key question founders need to ask: What capabilities are you hardwiring into your company’s DNA from day one?

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7368508799051075585,,Text,"Founders - What if I tell you that winning investors has nothing to do with AI features on your pitch deck?

Today, in this post-AI world, it’s tempting to believe that adding AI into anything will win investors. But the truth remains: AI only matters when it powers a product users genuinely love.

Just build a product which users love. 
Unreasonable, passionate love for your product.

See, investors don't fund companies. They fund movements. This is why the old rule still holds in the post AI world: If users love you, investors will follow.

It’s not magic. It’s psychology.

A genuinely loved product creates a Halo Effect. This powerful cognitive bias means one positive trait (user love) makes investors (Including us at Misfits as well :D) start believing that everything else is great too. 

Your team seems smarter.
Your market feels bigger.
Your traction becomes social proof, not just a metric.

Look at Dropbox. It got funded after tens of thousands users signed up from a viral demo, not a fancy deck. 

Or Razorpay, where word-of-mouth by real customers drove investor interest before pitch materials mattered. 

Or maybe look at Zoho. Their relentless focus on user love and organic advocacy helped them sail through without depending on investors.

Your first and most important proof point isn't a term sheet. It's a small group of users who can't imagine a world without you (Ok, BluSmart ended up being an exception but we all know what happened there…). 

That's the only validation that matters . 

Stop chasing capital. Build a gravitational pull that capital can't escape.

This is the principle of complementarity. Computers process data. Humans exercise judgment. The most valuable businesses are built where these two meet.

Have been thinking about this since last week. 

Today we're lumping together tools for making meme apps and platforms for building enterprise-grade internal tools.

These are not the same market. They are different products demanding entirely different go-to-market strategies.

This is a classic ""platform pivot"" moment. The critical choice isn't features, it's focus. Are you building a single killer application or a platform?

Most successful platforms started as the former. They proved their value with one great app for one specific user.

Winners won't build for everyone. They'll choose a persona, solve their problem completely, and earn the right to expand from there. #RightToWin

1. For law firms, the way they draft or review documents is almost like a signature. It’s part of their identity. Even for a standard NDA, each firm wants tweaks in format, workflow, and explanation. 

AI tools must let people “make it their own”. Any tool which tries to rob them of their identity will be discarded faster than the Meta Superintelligence Lab losing its top AI talent to xAI! 

2. In corporate legal teams or compliance roles, people care much more about saving time and money. 

If the AI can take care of boring or repetitive tasks and show visible improvement in process speed or error reduction, it’s much easier to win buy-in fast. 

Law firms, on the other hand, may bill by the hour or see client “service” as billing lots of time. AI isn’t always welcome if it threatens revenue or their established way of working.

AI adoption in legal is fastest where incentives align tightly.

3. Law firms move slowly and want to trust both the product and the people selling it. They want to see proof, have room for customization, and rarely leap for “new tech” unless something in the broader market forces their hand.

Law firms have enormous organizational and cognitive inertia. The longer their processes have remained unchanged, the harder it is to shift.

But why? Let me explain.

See, it's true that for investors the most expensive mistake in investing isn't backing the wrong company. It's getting scared off by the right one! 

The reason? A fundamental misunderstanding of market size.

I was listening to the 20VC podcast where Byron Deeter, who is a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, admitted how they got ""weak-kneed"" on certain (initially) low TAM startups and hence left (a lot of) money on the table. 

See, we're all trained to see TAM as a static number. A slice of an existing pie. But the generational companies don't just capture a market. They expand it.

Uber didn't just attack the taxi market. It created the market for transportation-as-a-service.

So, the most critical question for any founder or investor isn't ""what's the TAM?"" 

It's ""what's the unlock that makes the TAM 10x bigger?""

(And hence why waste time on the TAM slide?)
