Our star was the AI Gold Audit Agent - built for Bharat from the ground up with the stalwarts in the gold loan business.

But why we really stood apart is that we understood the biggest concern that Banks, NBFCs & Fintechs have in highly regulated market - #dataSecurity, especially when it comes to AI model interactions.

Our AI Middleware was the answer most were looking for - with the ability to build simpler AI agents for contact centre automations to highly complex agents like our AI Gold Audit Agent (where we use 5 different proprietary SLMs & 2 LLMs in a single workflow). And all of this deployed in your own Virtual Private Clouds in a single click.

And to top it all off, we were honored to be one of the few booths that our Indian Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi visited!

Back in 2016, at YES BANK, I had the privilege of working with Aseem Gandhi, Anup Purohit, Ritesh. Pai, Amit Shah and others to build what was possibly #India‚Äôs first #fintech accelerator. Around the same time, Abhishant Pant was propelling the #GovtofMaharashtra fintech program lead by Suniti Nanda and many more.

Fast forward to today, the progress is undeniable. But so is the opportunity ‚Äî to move beyond payments, and to shape how credit, wealth, and insurance can truly impact lives, especially in the era of AI. Feels like we've just seen the first decade of digital entrepreneurship and capital flow into Fintech in India, and the next two are going to be wild!

üëâ As we head into Mumbai, I‚Äôd love to hear your perspective:
 Which fintech white space do you believe remains most under-addressed today ‚Äî payments, credit, wealth, or insurance?

- Most companies are stuck at ‚Äúhorizontal copilots‚Äù (think: chatbots and surface-level automations). Cool demos, but‚Ä¶ business impact? Meh.

- The action‚Äôs in¬†agentic AI: actual agents that dive into deep, complex workflows and get real stuff done, not just answer questions.

- But it‚Äôs not about just plugging in Vertical AI to a data stream ‚Äîit‚Äôs about reimagining the way work and decisions flow, with agents(human & AI) at the center.

- For BFSI, this shift is even more urgent. Complex processes, heavy compliance, non-stop risk and fraud management‚Äîonly robust AI middleware can handle that at scale.

AI middleware will become your ‚Äúoperating system‚Äù for all these agents: secure, modular, governed, and agile enough for strict BFSI requirements.

Klarna reverts back to human-touch after attempting to entirely automate their contact centers, due to quality issues.

But I'm sure there's been a lot of gains made in that progress, not just for Klarna, but for everyone watching from the outside.
For one, Klarna has probably automated more than 80% of their customer queries, and tested the limits of what's possible with the existing suite of SOTA models. This will still mean a lot of cost savings for them, and is still the right path to take in 2025.

That said, it does open the doors for the actual issues that we've been recommending to our customers from day one. Here's a couple of obvious ones:

1. Humans aren't as comfortable talking to bots as they are to humans. Just like customers escalate issues from call center executives to managers when they get frustrated, they will continue to escalate things from AI agents to human agents. And this shortcut will get engrained into our muscle memory soon enough.

2. The best case scenario is that 80-90% of customer queries be automated through AI agents assuming they are mostly redundant queries. That said, this requires building a large centralized intelligence engine that gives AI models really good context of the entire business, previous issues faced by customers, and who the customer is to be really efficient. In my research, I haven't seen a company build it with the depth.

1Ô∏è‚É£ If prompt engineering works for your use case, stick with it. No need for RAG or fine-tuning if simple prompting gets the job done.

2Ô∏è‚É£ If prompt engineering isn‚Äôt enough but RAG solves the problem, go with RAG. It‚Äôs often more efficient than fine-tuning, especially when working with evolving knowledge bases.

3Ô∏è‚É£ If both prompt engineering and RAG fall short, consider adapter-based fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA). This allows targeted improvements without the heavy cost of full fine-tuning.

4Ô∏è‚É£ If even adapter fine-tuning isn‚Äôt enough, then full fine-tuning might be necessary. But be cautious‚Äîchallenges like catastrophic forgetting can arise.

5Ô∏è‚É£ There‚Äôs one more reason to consider fine-tuning/distillation: If you have a very specific use case (e.g., structured data parsing, simple summarization) and want to deploy a smaller, cheaper model (e.g., LLaMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek R1 7B) that can perform just as well but at a fraction of the cost.

Choosing the right approach depends on trade-offs between accuracy, cost, and complexity. What‚Äôs your go-to strategy?

- KYC & KYB verification
- Cross border money transfer stack
- AI document parsing & basic workflow automations

The scale of this event is just ü§Ø

Couple of takeaways from the first 2 days from the event:

- Some talks on AI was mostly generic stuff, but there was one by Shanker Ramamurthy that really called out the gap in financial industry when it came to adopting tech to serve SMEs fund gap, and how GenAI & embedded finance will give institutions a competitive edge over the rest. Some use cases for AI in finance in the image attached.

- Entering a global market is not easy for fintech startups, and was talking to many founders who did the same. ""Partnerships"" was the key to their success. Finding a GTM partner to co-sell and who really finds value in your product is key!
