It’s not enough to say we can build it, so let’s build it. The real question is: 𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅 𝗲𝗻𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵, 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝘂𝘀 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗺𝘀𝗲𝗹𝘃𝗲𝘀?

That’s why in infrastructure businesses like ours, embracing complexity is not optional—it’s the moat. A fintech will only adopt a new layer from us if they believe we’ve invested the time, scale, and depth that would otherwise take them months (or years) to replicate.

Sometimes this means building ahead of demand. When we started with digital FDs, the market wasn’t loudly asking for it. But we had to forecast the need, invest deeply, and become the lead indicator—so that by the time the demand arrived, the infrastructure was ready.

The same holds for our future products. It’s not about speed alone. It’s about 𝗯𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆, 𝗯𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗲𝗲𝗽, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗻𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘀𝗲𝗲 𝘂𝘀 𝗮𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗮𝘂𝗹𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲.

This morning I found myself feeling grateful for being part of a company like Fixerra . 
Work from home can sometimes feel like you’re not fully in it, the updates don’t always flow the same way, and the work you do isn’t always visible. But that doesn’t mean the contribution is any less.

What makes all the difference is the trust and balance the team creates. At Fixerra , I’ve experienced a culture built on trust and where outcomes matter more than constant check-ins, and life outside of work is valued just as much.

Back at XLRI, I remember choosing an elective that only a few picked — Social Entrepreneurship with Prof. Madhukar Shukla.

It wasn’t part of the “hot” marketing or finance specialisations, didn’t add much to credits, and certainly didn’t make for glamorous résumé points. But something about the idea of business serving more than profit drew me in.

On the first day, the classroom was almost empty — just a handful of us. But by the end of that semester, my mind felt fuller than it had in any other course. Prof. Shukla didn’t just teach; he made us live the course. We met social entrepreneurs who had built schools out of nothing, created livelihoods where there was none, and solved problems most of us never even noticed.

One moment that stayed with me was when a rural entrepreneur told us:

“The people I serve don’t need charity. They need a fair chance to stand on their own feet.”

It hit me — impact isn’t about 𝘨𝘪𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦, it’s about 𝘦𝘯𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦.

And in some ways, that’s what Independence Day is all about too. True freedom isn’t just the absence of restraint — it’s the presence of opportunity. And freedom flourishes when we enable others to stand tall.

That small, almost-forgotten elective changed how I think about business, purpose, and responsibility. It made me certain that entrepreneurship can be an act of nation-building — one business, one community, one idea at a time.

Type 1: “I’ve seen enough, I know how this works.” (Stops at PAN screen when checking any platform’s flow in the fintech ecosystem, assumes the rest is ‘standard.’)

Type 2: “Let’s see what happens next.” (Does the full KYC, books a ₹1,000 FD, applies for a loan or a card they’ll never take, runs 50 tiny transactions—just to see the cracks and the magic in that journey/backend.)

I’ve realised culture also shows up when someone says:

The answer actually is a Yes.

At  Fixerra, we’ve seen volumes grow steadily over the last few months.

But I don’t believe this surge is just equity money shifting to safer products. It feels more like people are starting to understand the value of asset allocation — spreading their investments wisely instead of chasing just one path.

Of course, markets will do what markets do — one big rally, and this wisdom might just get forgotten again.

Recent market volatility has been unnerving many investors. As we saw markets going on a one way rally🎢, we knew we had to get a product out for volatile markets that calmed investors portfolios (and their nerves!)

And thus came the latest product in our bouquet - Corporate FDs!

But then we had to bring our spin to it - these aren’t just by any issuers; these are by issuers vetted by Kotak 🛡️. With special rates for senior citizens and women - this becomes the perfect combination of return with risk.

Even tougher—how do you get them to trust you?

In financial services, trust is everything. It doesn’t matter if you have cutting-edge tech, AI, expert support, or the fanciest UI—your survival and success come down to one thing: whether your customers trust you.

But trust isn’t built overnight. It comes from consistency and reliability. One way to earn it is by offering services and products that people have trusted for years. That familiarity creates loyalty, and loyalty keeps customers coming back.

At Fixerra, our goal is simple: we help fintechs launch banking products that build this kind of trust and loyalty.

I’m not sure where this idea came from. Maybe it’s because I read somewhere that WhatsApp and Telegram achieved massive success with surprisingly small teams. 

Or maybe when our accountant warned me saying, “Post 20 employees, you’ll have to deal with compliance headaches!” 😄 

But over time, it’s become more than just a quirky principle. It’s now a core belief—to build a lean team that delivers maximum impact.

And here’s the surprising part: keeping things small hasn’t felt like a constraint. If anything, it’s been an advantage.

With a compact team, we don’t have the bandwidth for endless experiments, and everyone always has something meaningful on their plate. Everyone owns their role and wears multiple hats keeping us nimble and focused.

In the past two years, we’ve done a lot—we’ve pivoted, we’ve failed, we’ve celebrated wins- all with a small team that punches way above its weight.

But sometimes, I genuinely stop and think: ""Are these few people really enough to drive the impact we’re aiming for?"" And then, I realize the answer is a resounding yes.

As we grow, we’ll hold onto this belief, proving that sometimes, less, truly is more.

And no, I’m not too obsessed with the 20-member rule. I might consider 21... but only if she/he promises to help us setting up for the additional compliances too. 😄",216,9,0,9mo,Post,Akshar Shah,https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshar-shah-09427b76,https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshar-shah-09427b76/,2025-01-18T22:13:00.000Z,,2024-12-15T00:00:00.000Z,,

It’s funny because I hadn’t even studied for it. When the results came out, I was as surprised as anyone. Honestly this was luck more than talent.

That’s when I started doing my research, talking to friends and family, and realizing the incredible opportunity in front of me.

After preparing for the interviews, I got into XLRI, and that’s where my journey truly began. 

It was during my time there that I discovered my interest in finance and cleared first CFA Level too.

I interned at ITC and later received a placement offer. To everyone around me, I was the “lucky one.” 

But internally, I felt a conflict—I wanted to pursue finance, and ITC's job wasn’t aligned with that vision. I decided to take a leap of faith, rejecting the PPO and giving myself a chance.

In the final round of placements, Kotak came to campus and I converted it.

 At Kotak, I entered wealth management for HNIs and Ultra HNIs, which was completely new territory for me. Two years into it, I vividly remember being handed the personal portfolio of one of Asia’s wealthiest bankers. 

I was the youngest advisor he’d worked with, and the responsibility was daunting. 

But that challenge became one of the biggest lessons of my career. 

I then transitioned to building Kotak's in-house investment app Kotak Cherry as product lead and that's when I got introduced to the world of fintech.

My time at Kotak Wealth and Kotak Cherry laid the foundation for everything I do today and set the stage for Fixerra.

Turns out, not knowing the exam pattern was the best preparation I could have done.

Many fintech partners ask us what the difference is when another TSP like Fixerra has the same banking partner or when they connect directly with the bank or NBFC. What's the edge, the USP, the moat, and all the usual buzzwords 😀

I like to share stories to make my point, and today I have another one.

Recently, a large NBFC increased their FD rates, effective today. But it wasn’t a simple rate change — it involved different rates based on deposit amounts, even for the same tenure.

It was about a week of work — from product to tech to testing. But when you're live with some of the biggest apps and platforms in the country, how do you tell them you'll offer a subpar experience for a week with outdated rates?

This morning, I saw only Fixerra-powered platforms live with the updated rates and amount-based functionality. Huge kudos to our team for pulling this off!

This is where the USP and moat really show up — it’s about getting the details right, and making it happen when it counts 😃
