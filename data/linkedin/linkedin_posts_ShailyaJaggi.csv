You want your tidy excels and glossy pitch-decks to woo a room full of luminaries. The star employees, the 2x founders, the warriors in the conquest of life. 

And I believe ambition is the wheels to your car, your alloy, your ahoi! It‚Äôll take you from point A to point B, even on days when you‚Äôre a quarter tank.

Make it to your friend‚Äôs birthday and your distant cousin‚Äôs wedding. Spend chunky bucks on the dress you want to wear on either of the occasions. 

Please, please attend your child‚Äôs fancy dress and watch them write chronicles on a stage. Talk to your father. Your father is the least expressive and most sensitive man on the face of earth. 

Your aging mother would ask you fifty questions in a row about how to use a Swigit or a Blinky and I recommend you answer all fifty patiently. 

Take yourself on a vacation and wear your ‚ÄúI am saving it for when I am 5 kgs lighter‚Äù outfit. Get chatty with strangers. Listen more. You‚Äôll know how little you really are in this enormous world. 

Do anything but cut open your heart and dysfunction your family and unlove your lover for a job/business/empire. 

I can bet on my life that nobody will remember you for more than how you served them except the ones who love you selflessly. 

I earnestly believe that I am too young to casually throw around this piece of advice on a Sunday afternoon. 

But I‚Äôve seen closely, two of my closest people, inch closer to death for days until they surrendered to it. All they could recall were the faces dear to them, and all I remember about them now is how they lived and loved.

It‚Äôs something an internet friend once sketched for me after I gave her the vaguest, murkiest description of what I wanted.

It‚Äôs an abstract-ish face of a woman, and from inside her head bloom pansies that cluster into a book. The book endlessly shedding more flowers.

It was meant to remind me that knowledge would be the first reason I‚Äôd ever bloom like a flower. And pansies, they stand for love and affection.

For an eighteen-year-old, I was pretty committed to that thought. It was my 8th tattoo, I think.

But the thing with tattoos is over time, they become you. They stop feeling like a piece of art. Your own skin-painting. They are just‚Ä¶there. 

You scrub them with soap, tan them in the sun, hide them behind sweaters, and forget they even exist.

And then, one day, someone points to it and goes, ‚ÄúOh, you have a tattoo?‚Äù and it takes you a second to remember that you do.

Same with your big glimmery eyes that widen when you talk about something you love. The little mole under your lip. 

The dimple that‚Äôs a crowd-favourite. The way your eyebrows jump when you put the music on. The way your shoulders sway when you dance. 

Even the way you pronounce that one word weirdly, or laugh before finishing your own joke. All your little quirks that you find so easy to forget. 

You live with them every day, so you stop noticing. But they‚Äôre what make you jaw-droppingly beautiful and you‚Äôre an audacious little creature to not acknowledge them.

Born in Kashmir and raised in the courtyards of Bhopal, she grew up under the indifferent care of a stepmother who, like the ones immortalized in old bollywood movies, left her with scars that could scarcely be seen on her skin.

I remember when I was sixteen, I was just beginning to love Jane Austen. My grandmother, however, was married off in her sweet sixteen to a man she had never met before. 

She was a mother at seventeen, a mother of two at 25, a mother of 3 at 30. She was fierce, lady-like, significantly talkative. She was the architect of the family I would gladly pierce my heart for.

But I often find myself wondering what might her life had been if the world was kinder. Would she, too, have been enchanted by Austen on a summer evening? 

Would her inquisitive fingers have shot up in a classroom, eager to question, to answer? Would she rather wear a pair of jeans than a patiala salwar? 

She could have been a fashion designer, or perhaps a poet? I know, with cruel certainty, that she would have been remarkable with numbers. All finance bros would squirm in shame. 

Strange, no? A beautiful woman whose course of life has given me a beautiful story of my own. And at the same time, there‚Äôs a little horror in how a brilliance so alive could be subdued by circumstances. 

Anyway, my grandmother is the most stunning woman I have ever known. Wish she could get to know herself better.

Nobody bats an eye now when I discontinue working with a client who doesn‚Äôt respect my time.

But I started freelancing in 2018, back when freelancing wasn‚Äôt as mainstream. Everybody still glorified the grind, still wanted to toil and trade a piece of their flesh for a ‚Äúsecure‚Äù high-paying job.

Now when a 22-year-old respectfully tells their client, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt take calls after 9pm‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not available today‚Äù, a lot of people freak out.

Partly because they‚Äôre unfamiliar with the phenomenon of work-life balance. And partly because Millennials never had this level of autonomy.

Baby Boomers built enormous wealth and passed down favorable conditions to their kids. Millennials, by contrast, started from lower baselines (less inheritance, more debt, costlier housing and education). 

But Gen Z and younger Millennials are doing THE radical (go divas üíÖ) They‚Äôre trading security for agency. They‚Äôre freelancing, they‚Äôre building startups, they‚Äôre studying online, they‚Äôre becoming content creators. 

They know the housing/jobs/education equation has only gotten worse, but they‚Äôre still willing to make that trade-off for freedom, for LIFE. 

Yes, it‚Äôs a privileged stance. Not everyone has the safety net to quit a job or refuse a client when there are bills and families to support. 

But that should make employers and founders even more careful. Because the fastest way to exploit someone is to take advantage of the fact that they can‚Äôt set boundaries.

I love the people I meet through my work. I love that I get to buy another black purse. I love that I can travel around the world. I love that I can pay for my gym membership.

My name is Shailya. As in shall-yeah. And when I first showed up here, it was with my failures. I perused, got slightly confused, but thoroughly amused to see how crazy this place was. 

Hooks and e-books and virtual fights between writers and their words. So I began to write about myself, and then a little about my work. 

I wrote hooks and canva-ed the hell out of my carousels. I showed up every day at 9:30 AM to offer a little bit of ‚Äògyaan‚Äô. Funny thing is, the wiser you grow, the faster you run out of it. 

I‚Äôve made friends, made enemies, made my place in block-lists for having harsh opinions. But I‚Äôve found a shit load of work here, promoted myself from a freelancer to a business-owner, given my heart some beautiful women (and safe to say I can kill for them). 

I‚Äôve sobbed on all my pillows reading comments, I have screenshots of my dms in an album named ‚Äòlove‚Äô. I have worked with brands that I never thought would work with a lone lancer. I‚Äôve received so much love that my album‚Äôs out of storage space. 

And no, I don‚Äôt do the gyaan anymore. Or the personal-branding tricks or the client-result screenshots or the whatsapp testimonials. I‚Äôm sure that would bring me more ‚Äòleads‚Äô, but I‚Äôm here for whatever leads me to light..

Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking. No, he didn‚Äôt leave it as our inheritance. Nor did he mean for us to be heavily inebriated to escape the miseries that would unfold after his passing.

My papa was a man who knew nothing but hard work. He bowed down to kiss the ground where his shop stood, and had almost no vices. 

Except that one glass of whiskey he‚Äôd have every Sunday night before bed. Never two, never half, always one full. And he didn‚Äôt drink to get drunk. He truly revelled in its taste (absolute yuck).

One day, my mother was invited to another country for work. Her first international trip after years in corporate. And she knew exactly what to bring back.

For the man who was a little frugal, or rather family-first. The one who usually picked up a Blenders Pride for special occasions, though Officer‚Äôs Choice Blue was an undisputed winner.

Until my mother got him a Black Label. Drum rolls for the Black Label! It was the most expensive bottle he had ever held. And papa being papa, he kept it for when ‚Äúwhoever gets married first; you or your mom.‚Äù

We do that so often, don‚Äôt we? Save the best things for ‚Äòthat day‚Äô. But life is fickle. You never know if you‚Äôll live to see it. So when he was gone, both my mother and I were left with a bottle of whiskey that has now survived three movers and packers.

Over the years, my mother chose singlehood despite my repeated attempts to brainwash her into love again. So the renewed deal was that we‚Äôd open the bottle when I get married.

Again! The same old curse of saving something for ‚Äòthat day‚Äô. But haven‚Äôt we learned our lesson? That good things should be worn, devoured, loved, held, apologised for TODAY? 

Maybe we‚Äôll have a drink on a randomly happy day. When there‚Äôs no particular occasion or milestone to celebrate. On a randomly happy day, we‚Äôll open the 12-year-old Black Label that we‚Äôve kept safe for 9 years now.

Across the river stands a Buddhist temple, where the only music is the rustling of leaves. The serene-faced bhikkhu cleans the place twice a day.

Nearby, an old lady runs the smallest restaurant I have ever seen. Three tables, one chef, one host, and something tells me both of them have double the hearts.

In one sentence they‚Äôll ask ‚Äúinnum ve·πá·∏çumƒÅ?‚Äù (do you want more?) and before the next, ammaiyar will scrape the juiciest piece of chicken from the bottom of her pot.

Every time you stop for a coffee, a kind man appears with paper and pen, ready to give detailed feedback on your itinerary. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you how to see Sri Lanka, ok?‚Äù beats ‚Äúthis copy is good to go‚Äù any day.

I work from a balcony where five species of birds sing in their own do-re-mi-fa. It has only been two days, and I‚Äôm yet to see more of the country.

Now, it‚Äôs not every day you see a woman in a floral suit, hair parcelled in a neat ghungat, posing before the Eiffel Tower.

But that‚Äôs not the only sight I was marvelling at. It was the man beside her. In ten minutes, uncle had demonstrated fifteen different poses. 

He zoomed in, zoomed out, asked her to rest her delicate, wrinkled fingers on her hip. Then on her ghungat. And each time, he modelled first, so she could see exactly what he meant.

He did nudge her to take the ghungat off for a milisecond. And in rebuttal, she pulled it even closer to her forehead. Smirking. Laughing. Looking around to notice if anyone noticed. 

I glanced around too, expecting to see family. A son, a daughter, maybe grandchildren. But it was just the two of them, still holding hands long after the tower had stopped glimmering, long after most people had hurried off to catch their trains.

I wasn‚Äôt in awe just because I‚Äôd stumbled upon pure love for the first time. God has been kind enough to give me glimpses of it every once in a while. This was something else.

It was the spirit that moved me. The voice on the other end of their video call. The old man navigating a foreign city with one hand holding romance and the other a google map. 

Did their children send them here for their fiftieth anniversary? Or had she once looked at a film and sighed, ‚ÄúKitni sundar jagah hai,‚Äù and he waited until he could make that moment hers?

Maybe that‚Äôs what people mean when they say travel changes your life. Not because the places themselves hold the power to change you. But because they shift the way you see everything you already have.

Gosh am I grateful to have love! And the spirit? I‚Äôll collect whatever I can from moments like these.

Unearth your drawer that smells like old ink and forgotten candies to rescue your first plane ticket. Find your friendship bands. Reach out for that book so old that its title wore thin. Stare at the ID card from your first job long enough to know how far you‚Äôve come. Hug your mom. Revisit the song that was once on repeat for every cab ride. Cook a well-balanced meal in the kitchen alone and microwave the garlic before you peel it. Flip through the pages of your diary from 2021 and see if you can find ‚Äúi‚Äôm such a mess‚Äù in bold. Take out the jeans that you‚Äôve been saving for when you lose your flab, toss it away and wear your pajamas. Sit by a big window, or any window. Open the front-camera and try not to look at your pores. Just smile. Smile at the woman who dons a saree for work and is hurriedly scrolling through her office group chat in the elevator. Watch your favourite movie for the 13th time, and then watch one you‚Äôd always skip. Breathe reallyyyy big. Go home with a bag empty and come back with a bag full. Make your bed and tuck the corners real tight. Find a lamp that‚Äôs just right for midnight reading. Learn to love. Love hard. Write about how you wish you could hold your own hand when the plane lands a bit skittish. Dance like everyone‚Äôs watching and you‚Äôre freakishly comfortable being the superstar in your room. On a count of three, drop your phone, prompt less, and think more. 

If you copied this big chunk of text, do you know where you could paste it to produce good writing? Nowhere. So prompt yourself, not the artificially intelligent. Prompt yourself. :)

One has left their toxic family and moved to the mountains to set up their own hostel. One has a strict no work-calls after 7pm policy. 

One has fought cancer and proposed the girl of his dreams in a quaint little hill-station. One has adopted a turtle because kids are not on her list. 

One has travelled 20 countries under 30 and considers herself extremely rich. One is unabashedly chasing money to change the mood-board for her family. 

One is an influencer who gets a big cha-ching after every reel he posts. One hasn‚Äôt been on social media ever since they started meditating. 

One has gifted another some therapy sessions for her birthday. One has battled depression, studied religiously, and become a therapist.

I shut my eyes and repeat that thrice before a blank page. Sometimes you can‚Äôt reclaim words because in your head, you‚Äôre ‚Äòthe writer‚Äô. 

You‚Äôre the storyteller, the looked-up-to, the word wizard. But the second you drop this lordly idea of yourself, you come back to a place where writing finds you. 

It finds you in your first breakup, in your unforgiving childhood, in the mourning of your gone grandfather, in your jobless, helpless, and reckless days. 

It finds you in your baby‚Äôs first cry, in your last goodbye from a loveless home, in the moving-on and living-again from a pain you thought will never leave your body. 

Writing comes from your best and worst places. From humility and fragility and scarcity and hopelessness and hopefulness and forgiveness and a few more esses, I guess. 

It comes when you are down bad and down dirty but chin-up and very flirty. It comes as one of the schrodinger‚Äôs cats when you can laugh and cry at the same time. It comes from your best, not necessarily from the best.

I was convinced that it‚Äôs easy for me to get lost. That I struggle finding my way back home. That I can‚Äôt go to the movies alone and come back unworried. 

My partner calls me a duckling. I love shutting my brain cells and letting him fiddle with the maps and apps. But you know what he also says very often? 

‚ÄúI love that you‚Äôre my duckling, but I also know that if you were here alone, you‚Äôd navigate the shit out of this world. Because you‚Äôre that person. You‚Äôre fearless. You‚Äôre the duck too.‚Äù 

And he was absolutely right. Because I‚Äôve loved nothing more than finding my way back in a foreign land. Of course, I love being the duckling every once in a while, but that‚Äôs by choice, not by nature. 

Financial independence is great. But the freedom of movement, the tapping into your unexplored dora-the-explorer - it gives you so much power.

2) An ex-client came back with an urgent project and he was so sure that I‚Äôd help him that he took half a morning to close the deal. I delivered before time. 

3) This might mean nothing to some, but one of my clients broke down on the call. Rough days. We had a one-hour long conversation and I think we‚Äôre friends now (maybe? confirm if you‚Äôre reading this) 

4) topmate.io put me on the billboard for the second time. They‚Äôve also made my life fairly easy. And no, they didn‚Äôt pay me to say this. 

5) Every time, and I swear to God, every time I disappear from LinkedIn, or I sound a little off in the posts, I get 5 messages instantly. None of them transactional. They just want to know if I‚Äôm fine and that means the world to me. 

6) I‚Äôm writing a book. Because life‚Äôs too short and we almost escaped a war and the weather‚Äôs been crazy and global warming is global raging..you never know.

A tissue paper was beat hollow with the mouth-freshener, and then carefully tucked in pockets. 

One petite glass of tuity-fruity took multiple rotations until the last cherry went to the youngest in the house. 

Uniforms always hung loose on the shoulders because it was meant to last 3 years, sometimes even passed on. 

Now that I‚Äôve been promoted to a higher social class (which takes half luck and half work in this economy), I meet people who only want more.

Sharing is such an alien concept today, no? We want it all to ourselves. Owing to the hyper-independence that reeks of loneliness. 

And often, you will feel smart about having it all to yourself. You‚Äôll live in the illusion of wealth. You‚Äôll feel rich.

I knew this virtual friend from Instagram. A 27-year-old engineer. Tall, dark, handsome, and oddly invested in my outfit details.
 I once told him where I got my heels from, and a week later, he ordered the same pair.

One day, out of nowhere, I got a photo of him wearing a silk-green skirt and those heels.With a message that said ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt told anyone, but I‚Äôve always felt more like a girl.‚Äù

It took me aback. Takes a minute and a half to truly understand people. But you know how girls‚Äô girls are, right?
 They drop a ‚Äúyesss queen, you slaayyy, you set my phone on fire‚Äù in the comments.I did the same. For her.

Her close friends and I got an exclusive sneak peek into all her looks. Sometimes even the dates. But her family and friends? Completely unaware.

Until one day, she decided to put her heels down and come out. You‚Äôd hope the world to be all cotton candy and rainbows. But some things are hard to explain. Harder to accept.

It‚Äôs been two years since she last saw her parents. There was loud acceptance of their highly educated engineer son with the great job.

But an engineer daughter who got promoted, is half an artist, and has incredible taste in skirts?Not really.

And hers isn‚Äôt the only broken family I‚Äôve seen.There are many. I don‚Äôt paint my face or wave flags this month.
 But I do, earnestly, hope for acceptance and forgiveness. Acceptance from parents who still struggle to understand their children. Forgiveness from children whose parents once turned away and now try to embrace them.

I pray the broken families are mended.I pray.

Ah! My temple. It loves me. To be almost sick but never let me fall entirely. To carry me gently through the mess.

I wondered if I was loving it back as much. No movement. No dance. No strength training.
My pink dumbbells now carry abandonement issues. 

So I made a quiet promise to myself. That if my body is still fighting for me, I‚Äôll fight for it too.

I was a year old when she went job-hunting to become the sole bread-winner of the family. And in the same year, she was a wife, and then a mother, and then a divorcee. But the only role she chose fiercely, wholly, and without pause, was that of a mother.

So she did what no one had taught her to do. She began again. Her first job was transcribing medical records, her second was in a call centre.And while most people spent years waiting for promotions that never came,
 she walked up to her boss one day and said,‚ÄúI have a daughter. I can‚Äôt sit in this cubicle pulling night shifts. I can‚Äôt be in tele sales forever. I want a career. Give me something to grow into.‚Äù

And just like that, she never stopped growing. She moved cubicles and cities and offices. From a shared hostel to a stuffy PG, from a dingy BK to a sunlit BHK, and now we live in a home that finally feels like it has room for all the dreams she once postponed.

I‚Äôve never really understood the fuss around superheroes. They‚Äôve always seemed a little too shiny, a little too far away. Mine was here, right in-front of me, being a mother, a daughter, a sister, an empathetic boss, a problem solver, a birthday-rememberer, a tear-wiper - all at once.

If I could‚Äôve gone to fancy dress day dressed like her, I would have. And I almost did. Because the only superhero I believe in is my mama. And I am because she is.

And while shuffling between the beige and white, the abstract and contemporary, we quietly sneak in a decade-old bedsheet that adorns biologically absent flowers in all colors known to mankind. 

A stone pestle and mortar that have been passed on to four generations now, looks at our multi-functional mixer, grinder, juicer, and smoothie-maker in utter scepticism. 

And the steel masala daani may have been replaced with dainty glass jars, but a tin chocolate box still sits somewhere in the house, safe-guarding threads that are now as precarious as situationships. 

I‚Äôve lived in 5 homes in the past 25 years, and no matter where I went, I carried a hundred little things that witnessed my adolescence. The they-don‚Äôt-belong-here things. The beautiful things. The misfits. 

And for myself, I‚Äôve preserved these misfits in traits. A louder-than-necessary laughter in a formally quiet room. The ketchup-song dance wherever the song plays, however reserved the setting. 

I safekeep the child-like hop in my walk, the unapologetic giggle, the Uttar Pradesh dialect occasionally slipping through my carefully chosen vocabulary. The little things that may not go well with the rest of me, but they make me. 

The beautiful things. The silly things. The misfits.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7324675807056928768,,"In 2006, a deadly fire broke out in Meerut. 

I spent 15 years of my life in that town. My mom, always the busy boss lady, walked in heels, spoke in bullet points, and took calls like her phone was an extension of her hand. But no matter how important the meeting, she never missed our mommy-daughter dates.

One of those dates was at Victoria Park, during a consumer electronics fair. From what I remember, it was a good date. But the next morning, everything changed.

Relatives who hadn‚Äôt called in years were suddenly calling, frantically. A huge fire had broken out at that same fair. 65 dead. 150 injured. The attendance had been over 2,000, a staggering number for a small town like Meerut.

One of the victims was a girl from my tuition class. We weren't close, but I knew her. She used to tap her pen against the table when she was bored. She‚Äôd been absent for weeks. And when she finally returned, she was quiet in a way children shouldn't be.

Her entire left arm had third-degree burns.
She always wore long sleeves after that. Pulled them down every time they threatened to reveal anything. Sat smaller. Spoke less. Moved carefully. 

I won‚Äôt lie and say no one noticed. Kids always notice. For a long time, she was the girl who burnt her left arm, even if nobody said that out loud. 

As days went by, she began to care less. Stopped hiding the arm. Raised it in class. High-fived with it. Joined us for tippy tippy tap during break time. And slowly, I stopped seeing the scar too. 

I saw her eyes light up when she talked about acrylic paints. I noticed the bright pink of her top. The pretty pencil box she had - one of those with buttons that popped open compartments like magic. She was kind. Funny. Braver than all of us combined. And yes, maybe a little rich too, we all envied that pencil box! 

Over time, her scar stopped being the thing that defined her. The scar became her, not the other way round. You know how broken glass still catches light? She was all light. She was sparkle, she was beautiful. 

And that‚Äôs what I want to tell you. You, carrying things no one else can see. You, who flinch when someone touches a part of your story.

You are everything but your scars.And everything because of them, too.

One of my posts blew up beyond the linkedin galaxy. It was on the news, on Instagram, on Threads, on Reddit. I swear on my sweetest poem, I didn‚Äôt see that coming. 

And predictably, a few brands reached out to me for collaboration. I thought, quite a lot, and politely said no. But a part of me wondered if I was too irrational, too righteous, too haughty, too i‚Äôm-not-an-influencer-i‚Äôm-a-writer kind? 

It‚Äôs not to say that there‚Äôs something wrong about being an influencer, or that writers don‚Äôt sell. We make you believe that you‚Äôll never fly if it weren‚Äôt for an energy drink. 

But there‚Äôs a pretty girl here who once said she‚Äôd want an elder sister like me, would it be fair to elicit a desire in her for a thing she can do without? 

And then there‚Äôs a young writer, fresh out of school, who told me our lives are the same. Do I now become the ad she can‚Äôt skip within 5 seconds to jump to her story time?

I‚Äôm ridden with the curse of over-consumption. 5 lipbalms, a moisturiser for the day and then one for after noon, 15th version of the same goddamn jeans, a shampoo 10 times the price of a shampoo. I‚Äôve caved in. I‚Äôve fallen prey. Do I carry out the hunt now? 

I‚Äôm sorry if this is poking the marketer or founder or influencer in you. It poked me too. But isn‚Äôt it true? Isn‚Äôt this what we do? 

Yes, I do write for some of these brands. I have bills to pay, a pocket to fill. If I don‚Äôt write that headline, someone else will. But here? It‚Äôs all me. It‚Äôs my prose and my woes and ups and hiccups and downs and frowns. It‚Äôs all me. 

Here, nobody can tell my story better. So, pray tell! Am I a fool if I just want to..be?

But if only you knew how many women..

I was once in a room with four, far away from home. A hostel is a place where solo travel ends, because you only have to meet eyes once or help someone settle in their bunk before you become friends. 

So me, and my four new friends sat in a circle with our adult beverages and talked about it. We mutually agreed that not all men. But how many women? 

All four raised hands, and then I, the fifth. While one‚Äôs abuser was a close relative, the other was persecuted by her own partner. I remember we weeped a little when a girl narrated an abominable interaction with her own father. Her father. 

And even though all of us were terrified, heartbroken, shook, tired, we looked at each other as if we were there to reclaim freedom. To reclaim days and nights and moments and joys and love. 

To go on post-dinner walks without scanning danger in faces, to sit in a cab without tracing the maps, to walk into a boardroom and actually be heard, to make a friend fearlessly, to not overthink our dresses five times before we leave home. 

We hugged, we smiled, we laughed, we went to a party in a group of five and danced like nobody was watching. But alas! Everybody was watching. 

So yes, I‚Äôm in agreement. Not all men. But if only you knew how many women..

These three words come second only to ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù in a more platonic, you‚Äôve-got-my-vote kind of way. But they always confused me.

What do I deserve more of? Recognition? Work? Money? Vacations? Rest? Peace? Joy?

If they‚Äôre all the result of each other, do I deserve more of everything? 

To find answers, I started chasing more. More validation, more projects, more savings, more holidays, more nap hours, more writing, more writing again.

But every time I got more of one thing, another quietly slipped away. If not entirely, then at least a little.
 You know when you want more money to visit Italy in the summer, but to earn more money, you're stuck in your work chair with Uffizi Galleries on your desktop? 

It took me a while to understand what people mean when they say more. 

My best friend sends me flowers every time I bag a new client. My boyfriend takes me out for dinner on my worst writing days.
 My mother likes everything I write. Everything. Isn‚Äôt that ridiculously beautiful? And then there‚Äôs you. Some of you have been around for three years now and you still show up to say,

Many pointed out that while she looked fine from the outside, it was critical to check for internal structural damage. Thank you for that, we‚Äôre not as car-literate as we thought. 

Within a few hours, Tata's team reached out and set up a WhatsApp group with seven absolute champions. Since my mom drives the car to work every day, I was a little stressed reading the comments and conveyed the same to the team. 

Suzy was put through the full works:Chassis inspection, underbody stress tests, frame distortion checks..(look at my big car lexicon) 

She came back home fine and BEARING gifts! Guys, I‚Äôm not an influencer. So this grand gesture and brand-love left me and my mom a little fuzzy inside.

Special thanks to Mr. Prasoon Singh and Mr. Vikram Singh Suri - two incredible senior leaders who handled everything with absolute care. Honestly? They looked so proud. All of them.

I‚Äôve said this before, and I‚Äôll say it again. Writing to me comes close to worshipping, I wouldn't do it to mislead. Never have I been open to paid promotions. This was a genuine mishap salvaged by great people. 

The virality, however, did lead people to my writing (which I‚Äôve been doing here for 3 odd years now). I have new clients to attend to and hot leads to nurture, all thanks to you.

Yesterday, our Nexon took on physics and won. We had parked her at a multi-level parking lot. Got a call from the security telling us that the lift above our car broke down. 

She took a whole sedan plus the weight of the broken lift. We thought we‚Äôll find a pancake instead of our Suzy (yes, the car has a name), but she stood there like an absolute beast. 

Slightly bruised, sure. But no serious damages, no dents, no attitude. 

You‚Äôre welcome for the user-generated crash testing. We‚Äôre available for brand deals and lifetime free servicing (just kidding, but also not really) 

Edit: you‚Äôre all sweeties for genuinely showing concern. we‚Äôll get Suzy thoroughly checked before she takes us out again. thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è

When I was little, my mom would listen to the saddest songs ever made. Mohammad Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar, Abida Parveen. Songs that were cried more than they were sung. 

At the time, it was just hauntingly beautiful music with a little gibberish to me. But years later, I realised it mirrored my mother‚Äôs sorrow. She took refuge in those voices.

We spent years at my grandparents‚Äô home. And then a decade in and out of rented apartments. Just the two of us. Two best friends, tossing our days and nights into a cardboard box marked ‚Äòfragile.‚Äô

We were indeed fragile. In the most regenerative way possible. We knew how to steal joy from the tougher times. But having our own place? Our arms were always shy of miles to reach that dream.

You know when the universe is in agreement and sends a bit of luck to accompany you? Just when you‚Äôve had nothing more, nothing less, but enoughhhh? I believe that‚Äôs what happened with us. We were suddenly sharing a room with luck. 

And one day, we found ourselves in a partially broken home that was all ours. Our home. Our home. Our home. (1.5 years later, it‚Äôs as hard to say and believe). 

Every time we came here to knock the POP and critique the paint and measure the bar, we‚Äôd cry our eyes out. In utter disbelief, in gratitude, in pain, in devotion. 

We‚Äôd debate about what carpet would match the sofas, and then watch each other turn green. There‚Äôs something sweetly terrifying about dreams coming true, and we weren‚Äôt privy to this fear. Because none of ours had ever come true. 

But the last time we sat in our undone living room, we decided to switch things up. We packed a shit load of my world-famous maggi and some coke. Laid a bedsheet on gravel and stones and took it all in.

And then I heard the song - Ye shaam mastani, madhosh kiye jaaye. On my mother‚Äôs phone. ‚ÄúDid I just hear a happy song, our first happy song together?, I bellowed out. 

And that‚Äôs what I wish for whoever‚Äôs reading this. I wish you nothing less than a whole playlist of happy songs.

 We show up.
We write bad. 
We journal silly.

It doesn‚Äôt have to be La Dolce Vita and bouncy hotel beds. From what I remember, I once shared a bathroom with 15 surprisingly hygienic millennials and took the topmost bunk bed of my own freewill. 

Enter a restaurant alone and sit on a round table. You wouldn‚Äôt want to, but get yourself a big meal. Not a quickie sandwich you can grab and rush out so that people never learn that you‚Äôre alone. BIG meal. And chew exactly 32 times on each bite. 

Try their local food. Like it or hate it, but try it. And if you‚Äôre in an unknown land, I‚Äôd recommend keeping hot-sauce in your fanny at all times. 

Be terribly scared and anxious, if you are. To find  the immigration queue or your bus stop or the train route that leads to your bnb. But in about a day‚Äôs time, you‚Äôll throw bouquets and croissants at your own audacity. You‚Äôll walk taller. Perhaps not on a cobble street of a 60-degree incline, but you‚Äôll be proud. 

Talk to people in their language and watch a smile touch their ears from left to right. And at least a hundred times in your life, pluck a fruit from an actual tree and eat it in the sun. Not in the shade, in the sun. It‚Äôll make you realise just how little you are in this big world, and how important you‚Äôve mistaken trivial things to be. 

Clutch your purse to your heart and pray that nobody steals it, you‚Äôll learn caution. Wake up at 5am for the sunrise while everyone else is laying hungover, you‚Äôll never settle for less. Trek till the top of any tiny or ginormous hill, you‚Äôll never fear uncertainty. 

Nothing changes you like travelling. As someone whose workplace is also their home, I have to find my world outside my four walls. I have to go places when I‚Äôm the most afraid to. And while being alone back at home is suffocating, being alone outside in the big world is more freeing than you can imagine. 

I‚Äôm really not the one to give advice. I‚Äôm a learner at heart, and shall always be one. But if you‚Äôre in your 20s and reading this, take my word for it and travel more.

It‚Äôs hard, no? To tell a colleague that most of your smiles are fake. To talk to your teenager about sex and drugs and young romance. To tell a sibling that they absolutely sucked at being the elder one. To tell your partner that they need to stop reminding you how small your problems are. 

You could have the memory of a 2 year old and still remember how people made you feel. Because thank-effing-goodness, feelings aren‚Äôt facts. They leave a load on your chest. And it‚Äôs as hard to confront your feelings as it is to confront the person who caused them. 

Withholding is a terrible curse, and I spoke myself out of it quite recently. I refuse to be politically correct, readily available, internally a clustershit and externally the telly-tubby‚Äôs sun with a laughing baby face on it. 

Withholding makes you pretend, it makes you smile when you don‚Äôt want to, it makes you say ‚Äòyes‚Äô for the 100th time that you‚Äôve wanted to say ‚Äòno‚Äô. It makes your loved ones clueless and your younger ones great liars. It‚Äôs harmful for your heart, and the bees. It‚Äôs killing the bees (or is it phones that are?). 

If you‚Äôre planning to do yourself and the people you care about a favour, let it be an uncomfortable conversation.

I don‚Äôt know if ChatGPT is out to get your jobs yet, but it‚Äôs definitely keeping young writers from the beautifully chaotic process of writing. 

I miss that misfit of a phrase sitting in the middle of a post, an aimless comparison of your heartbreak to the unkept bedside table. The messy writing, the diary writing, the screaming-at-a-blank-screen writing. I miss all of it. 

I‚Äôve been noticing a certain sameness in the content here. And it breaks my heart to know that writers who are perfectly capable of telling their own stories are so heavily dependent on AI. 

Sure, it‚Äôs meant to make your life easier, but only when you‚Äôre good at what you do. You were not meant to write good prompts. You were meant to write good. You were meant to make mistakes. You were meant to look at your poem and think ‚Äúurgh, it‚Äôs not quite there yet.‚Äù 

Writing takes some heavy brain-exercise. Play with words, twist a sentence to extreme madness, draw parallels between a watermelon and your life, give a whole new meaning to the most overused word in the world‚Äôs dictionary. That‚Äôs the beautiful chaos. 

For some, it‚Äôs too soon to make things easy. I say, make things hard. Think. Challenge that thinking.

Growing up, I watched my mother become twice a parent. Both nani and I would enter a doctor‚Äôs clinic nervously tapping our feet on the marble floor, while mom knew exactly where to go. 

She‚Äôd hug us the same, as if she wanted to clasp our years, freeze the time. She would still keep the clothes I had outgrown, collect my hairclips in an empty chocolate box. And every time she caressed her mother‚Äôs hand, I could tell she was afraid that her wrinkles had multiplied. 

Sweets came home for both the kids. But one was shown the horror of bad and broken teeth, the other was reminded of diabetes. Rebellion, however, was strong against each cause. 

You know what mothers say to explain their sloppy kisses on your fully grown face, right? A child eternally remains a child for her. But it‚Äôs not the same for us, is it? Mom‚Äôs always mom, but in a jiffy of a few decades, she‚Äôs also the baby. 

Somewhere in the midst of crumpling bills into balls, falling in and out of love, cursing your job, finding your vocation, planning the same trip for the third time this year, it slowly sinks in that times have changed. 

One day you‚Äôll pull her to the other side of the walkway to battle the racing traffic of the city. You‚Äôll rote-learn your own prescription, but set phone reminders for hers. She‚Äôd be watching her favourite show on a rainy morning of July and you‚Äôll bring her a hot roti straight from the kitchen, just like she did for you. 

You‚Äôll delay your trip because she can‚Äôt sleep alone when she‚Äôs sick. You‚Äôll sneak in some chocolates for your cheat days, but they‚Äôd be stashed away in a drawer far from her frail hands. Hands that love those goddamn, beautiful, wrinkles. Wrinkles that hold your childhood. 

And that role-reversal? The most bitter-sweet part of adulthood.

Your social media reach does matter. 

I have written a total of 50 posts in the past 6 months. Against all rules of LinkedIn, right? If you‚Äôre consistent on a platform, you could write a poem on donkeys and get massive reach.

Then what‚Äôs the point of laying bare your soul for complete strangers? At least that‚Äôs what I thought. I‚Äôve tasted the high of that initial virality.  Loved it, but never enough to chase it. 

A wise woman once told me, and quite angrily so, that you MUST care about your reach. That people hear what you say. That you move the needle even when the meter‚Äôs not in plain sight. 

We don‚Äôt understand how powerful words are until a single quote answers your decade-old question. Until a book wraps you in its yellow pages and pulls you out of a dark place. Until a dialogue from a movie changes your personal misery into a universal experience to bandaid your wound. 

You think you want to be known by thousands and lakhs of followers. But then one night, someone DMs you saying ‚Äúi cried reading your post because i didn‚Äôt know anyone else felt this way‚Äù and you realise what being known really means. Not by many, but by one. Completely. 

Words build bridges. And they burn them too. They make strangers fall in love and best friends fall apart.

I‚Äôve seen people overuse the weight of ‚Äòforever‚Äô and underplay a ‚Äòthank you‚Äô in response to a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you, kid!‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen them play hide&seek with metaphors and divulge a painful detail cloaked in humour. I‚Äôve seen them weep in words, laugh in words, love in words. People remember you because you made them feel seen when they were hiding. Heard when they were screaming into pillows. Loved when they couldn‚Äôt find it at home. 

Your words did that. Your one little scribbling of a post did that. And your consistency made it reach someone who needed it the most. 

I say chase that reach. You never know who‚Äôs walking taller today because they found your words at the right time. Try not to measure your worth by the outcome, but chase regardless. 

I know I will. And I‚Äôm terribly sorry for gatekeeping what I had to say. Not anymore.

I‚Äôm a quarter past life and I have never met my biological father. But having grown up without one, I can tell you that abandonment issues come to the surface way before you‚Äôve even tucked that term into your word bank. 

You start believing that love is earned in half only when it‚Äôs showered in twofold. There‚Äôs a skin-crawling anxious attachment with a person who romances you beyond their emotional capacity. Would he still love me if he found me sobbing on a Monday morning? What if he learns I‚Äôm not a fan of rock music? ‚ÄúHey Siri, play ‚Äòwhole lotta love‚Äô and make me like it.‚Äù

One would think a man chose not to see his first-born grow into a woman because he‚Äôs demonic like that. Or is it something you can get away with? Or is the guilt of leaving so heavy on their chest that it chokes them from saying anything at all? I‚Äôd never know. 

Last night, I put my earphones on for the first time in a long time and listened to a eulogy from a son to his father. He said, ‚ÄúIt was easier not to forgive him. As long as I was living the life that he had ruined, any mistake I made could be laid at his feet for the childhood that I grew up in.‚Äù 

I felt it right in the gut. Because whether or not he knows, I had forgiven my father ages ago. Not because he was worthy of my forgiveness, not because my beautiful mother overcompensated for the void, not because my grandfather dyed his greys so that he didn‚Äôt look different from the other dads at PTA meetings. 

Because forgiveness is something you choose for your own sanity. Because for as long as I have love, I want to absorb every iota of it without a hint of insecurity. Because why would you expect abandonment from people who do anything but leave your side? 

And so, you choose forgiveness. You choose to live the life you deserve.

At first you think the air is heavier than your footsteps. There‚Äôs an eerie silence that bores through the cries. And even in the scorching sun, your immediate ambit is cloudy, it‚Äôs colder. 

But a lengthy minute later, you see the world in a different light and drop your shoulders. You‚Äôll understand the transience of time. You‚Äôll notice that the straightest face is in disbelief while tears trickle down in acceptance. 

He worked his fingers to the bones to bring her every piece of the rainbow, but his wife will pick the most colorless saree from her wardrobe. His father wonders whether he could have lent him a winter of his life. 

What remains of his knowledge is what he passed on in values. In the way his daughter grows another spine to come of age before time, in the way she gulps a cry down her throat to be the stronger one. 

No person in your vicinity who speaks of his title. ‚ÄúHe was kind, he was loving, he always smiled at me.‚Äù You‚Äôll witness a man being reduced to the memories of him. And whether or not he lived a good life, these can still be good memories. 

You‚Äôll see people passively preparing themselves for his absence. Transferring contacts to their phone, wearing their wrist-watch again to be early everywhere. 

There‚Äôs murmur all around. Some concerning grief, some about the 2 carat diamond ring on a certain Mona maasi‚Äôs finger. Faces irrevocably deprived of their glow, faces waiting to clock out of their performance. 

You‚Äôll see what‚Äôs left behind a human is still life- in all its futility. And life, as it‚Äôs always known to do, just goes on. 

So if your ultimate purpose is to build a legacy that can only be signed off or wealth that can only be willed, think again. Life after you will go on with and without the tangibles.

Memories? Thats quite something to leave people with. Be kind, be loving, smile more often, share your time. Live for the intangibles. Live before you can‚Äôt.

The internet cannot know everything. People do business with strong-headed people. The bouncy-balls. Shock and dejection and failure bounces right off them and they‚Äôre back again in all their glory. 

But me? I grieve in words, I laugh in words. I write on a public platform as if we‚Äôre a big whatsapp group of friends. Over 23,000 people here know that I‚Äôm partly shredded, partly a person. And that I have 13 tattoos, no pets, social anxiety, 500 unread messages, and a little trauma literarily locked away. 

Not a single soul on earth who doesn‚Äôt like to be seen, even when hiding is their second nature. I like to be seen too. The likes, the comments, the DMs, the love, the criticism. None of that attention eludes my pride. I would undoubtedly bring up my 23,000 followers in a conversation with a random stranger. 

Is that the reason why I overshare? Hell to the naw naw. I overshare because I write. I write a lot and I write about everything. For anyone who has ever met me on a Friday evening, they‚Äôd be concerned to learn that I write more than I talk. 

Personal branding left the window a long long time ago. I market myself outside of social media. I do honest work, and an even more honest attempt to get to that opportunity. But here? I just write. 

Because when I do, I earn quite a lot. In a globally aspired currency. I earn silent friendships, loud friendships, a big hug for a small win, a phone-call in dire times from someone I helped a decade ago. A lot more, I‚Äôd say. But I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs an act of class to keep some of your wealth hidden.

It has been over a year since we moved into our new home. A couple of days before our house-warming, we knocked our neighbours‚Äô door to give away hello-donuts. Perhaps a goodwill gesture, more so because we love making friends. 

We never heard again from most of them, but our next-door family reciprocated and how! A 40-something handsome doctor, a brave mom, a dad who was rather shy, and a dog who introduced us to every decapitated toy she owned. 

We got friendly with doc in no time. His turquoise eyes, wide smile, and vocabulary of a conversationalist- all so welcoming. And aunty? She had learnt that we‚Äôd rather have her low-calorie choley bhaturey than aaloo cutlet. 

What we shared was more than a wall. A vocal friendship. My mom would come back from the duty-free with chocolates for both me and doc. And he thought he had to return the gesture, so he brought gifts for the skincare enthusiasts that we are. One of the nicer dermats, this man. 

He had once mentioned about his depressive episode, and then assertively told us that he had gotten better. Of course, with that wide sparkly smile that he had, we believed him. 

But this Monday morning was easily the most scarring of my life. Around 8:30 am, our house-help came rushing to our room and told us that he was gone. I am sure not willingly, but intentionally. I don‚Äôt want to give out many details, but I know that I will never be able to see that 360-degree view of the city from our terrace again. 

It hasn‚Äôt sunk in. It hasn‚Äôt sunk in that he is gone, it hasn‚Äôt sunk in that the last time I saw him, he still had that big smile on his face. It hasn‚Äôt sunk in that he was beyond repair, and still so..normal. 

It has never hit me harder that depression doesn‚Äôt look the same on everyone. And men, especially, feel this constant need to be strong. To be the man. The man who smiles through everything. Even internal demise. 

I don‚Äôt know who has a friend or neighbour or family that needs to hear this. Please, seek help. Being strong is seeking help. Being strong is admitting that you haven‚Äôt been.

No, not because he wanted me to spread my wings and be the wind beneath them. He, in all seriousness, told me that I was a small bird on their porch who grew into a big little girl. It was a 15-minute theatrical response to the inescapable question of ‚Äúwhere did I come from?‚Äù

I spent most of my childhood with my grandparents, and they had lived more stories than they could read to me from a Champak. Every time I couldn‚Äôt find answers or joy in little things, they told me an elaborate story. 

Sick day? Khichadi dates back to 8th century BCE, a royal culinary wonder that Draupadi would often feed the Pandavas. He‚Äôd serve a generous dollop of Boroline to his skin and tell me about his encounter with Rishi Kapoor at a bar. While of course, I ennnjoyyedd khichadi. 

My life was a storybook, and every day a chapter. That‚Äôs just how powerful storytellers are. When all glitter‚Äôs not gold, they still smear it on everything. World shines. It shines so bright! 

I wasn‚Äôt passed on books or magazines or art or culture. I think they lost touch with education after the 10th board. But I was passed on stories that I remember till date. Stories that would wrap mundane in magic and sit on my tongue for years. 

Seven years of writing and I still can‚Äôt call myself a storyteller. The bar‚Äôs set too high. 

But do yourself a favour and find storytellers. Befriend them, steal their minutes, and if you happen to catch them right after their second drink (of whatever is their age-appropriate beverage), you‚Äôll get lucky. 

P.S ‚ÄúThis toy bounces back every time you hit it hard, and life sometimes treats us like a toy. You‚Äôll hear laughter and bitter words and celebration of your defeat, but you bounce back!‚Äù

Pan the camera to the right and there‚Äôs a wall that touches my bed. To the left is a kitchen with ears, and perhaps is still privy to my teen secrets. 

If you think the bedsheet is forcibly floral, my blanket would give you a garden of nightmares. But this is where I sat, mostly by myself, to dream big. 

I‚Äôd spend my weekly pocket-money to get a cassette loaded with bollywood songs, and dream of a space to dance until the tape was manually rolled out by my pinky finger. 

The first page of my diary read my life goals. A dress from the big mall, a house for my mom, a whole pizza to myself, a trip to anywhere with beaches, or maybe New York because every rom-com opened with ‚ÄòEmpire State of Mind‚Äô. 

The best thing about small rooms is that they always have room for dreams. Big dreams. 

Today, when I look around, nothing seems real. My many-hued rug, a fridge full of things I buy and forget to eat (mostly broccoli), and I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say that my closet is a mall in itself. 

When people ask me what my big dreams are, I buffer. I am still buffering. The truth is, I am living all of them. There‚Äôs a lot of space in my room, and I‚Äôve run out of songs to dance on. This is all the life I wanted. 

And while it‚Äôs easy to look above and beyond and afar, only to feel that you‚Äôre yet to have more, I look back. I look here. I look at my room from 10 years ago. 

If that little girl knew that the world is her diary and she writes for a living, she‚Äôd dance right there on the bed.

And in true LinkedIn fashion, I‚Äôll tell you how.

Another listicle (whattt?)! 

1. I relied solely on references and word-of-mouth, which is a decent boost to self-esteem but you‚Äôre more likely to exhaust this network of leads. Make your presence known on social media, reach out to people, beg for work if you have to. Your talent is not directly proportional to your number of monthly inbound leads. 

2. Try not to chase only high-ticket clients in the first two years. When you oversell as an under-experienced freelancer, you‚Äôll meet the infamous imposter syndrome at every step of the way. Learn, learn, and learn before you put a price tag on your services. 

3. Learning doesn‚Äôt mean being able to deliver. It means being able to deliver, analyse, double down on what‚Äôs working and pivot when a project tanks, people-managing, client relationships, and bringing in some actual ROI. There‚Äôs no shortcut to any of this. 

4. I‚Äôve gone months without work, slept on prospects and proposals, have beautifully underperformed at times. If your health (mind or body) are not in your favour, freelancing is going to be a bumpy ride. Fix your problems before you draw up an invoice to fix someone else‚Äôs. 

5. Get rid of your ego, please. If you started with a niche, called yourself a master/expert/ninja/messiah, and somewhere down the line realised that it‚Äôs not scalable, or not for you - switch! Accept your defeat, change your LinkedIn tagline, get that full-time job, find what else you‚Äôre good at. People will talk about it for a day and move on. 

6. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked for 100+ Founders and Entrepreneurs and Zamboni drivers in 2 years‚Äù. When you read this, smirk and scroll past it. If I could tell you the number of people I have been friends with (who you definitely follow here) that blatantly lied about their work, you‚Äôll pay me for the tea. And they‚Äôre talking about retainers ffs. How bad are you that you were able to disappoint a hundred people in 2 years?! Internet is FULL of lies. Focus on your own work. 

7. Have role-models, admire their work, take inspiration, but try not to always follow their lead. It‚Äôs very possible for an experienced person to do it wrong, or perhaps their way is not meant to be your way. If you oppose the cancel-culture, protest the worship-culture too. 

8. Your next obvious step after having tons of leads in your pipeline doesn‚Äôt üëèüèª have üëèüèª toüëèüèª be üëèüèª an üëèüèª agency. Just because every second person you know wants to become a Founder, you don‚Äôt have to shy away from your ambition. Bigger is not always better. If this is not the right time or the right thing for you, be unabashedly lowkey. 


I have 10 more so I‚Äôll do a part two because it‚Äôs a weekend and I need to chill. :)

If I could count the number of young poets and diary-writers who have asked me this question, I‚Äôll run out of all creases on my fingers. 

I started quite early, perhaps when I stopped googling quotes for a Facebook status and began to write my own. I wrote love essays on my friends‚Äô walls (not the ones fortifying their homes). 

I wrote rhymes, free-verse, sometimes nothing substantial and gave it the title of ‚Äòabstract‚Äô. My first portfolio was made on Google docs a day after chastising my 12th board marksheet. 

I got paid for blogs, articles, FAQs, keyword-research. SEO? I took up a course and learnt what digital marketing was all about.

I took everything that came my way. Dignified work? Sure. Need help for your college essay? Sure. Your baby‚Äôs first birthday invitation card? The quickest yes. 

I would attend college, go back home for client work, record voiceovers over the weekend, and go 35 hours without sleep to shoot the films I had written with people just as curious as I was. 

I wrote erotic, I wrote philosophy, I wrote research papers, I wrote ads, I wrote emails to random strangers on the internet. 

I‚Äôve lost count of the number of odd projects I‚Äôve taken. Some worked, some I completely sucked at. 

But I know exactly why there was so much room for experimentation. This was the time when social media was nothing more than a weekly escape for me. I didn‚Äôt know how better or worse were people of my age doing. 

So I did what I had to. I started everywhere, I found myself somewhere. 

Where should you start? 

Wherever there‚Äôs less noise about how many figures you can earn in a month. Wherever they don‚Äôt have the secret sauce for lead-generation or whatever‚Äôs the new buzzword. 

And if money is the problem, take up a job and start behind-the-scenes. Start with trying to write what you love to read. Just start somewhere right. :)

Perhaps on Facebook, or was it Orkut? I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything serious, forby I was too young for love. 

Little commitment, more exploration. We would flirt, hold hands, dream, dance..

At first, we only met on rainy days. Those particularly somber evenings when you have to read a pretty poem and recite it to your aching heart. 

And then we began to find each other on the joyous ones. Loneliness was a populated town, and we evaded it with our love. 

But something changed when we performed together on the school stage. I don‚Äôt remember seeing a single pair of hands that didn‚Äôt clap. 

The sparks, the romance, the alchemy. All too evident. 

Something told me that we were end-game. And I must have been audacious to show us the commitment I did. I have my love tattooed on my forearm for God‚Äôs sake! 

It has been 14 years now. We meet in agony, in glee, in laughter, in tears. We‚Äôre late for our date on Mondays, but Sundays are only for us. 

We‚Äôve spent weeks and months without each other, and they‚Äôve always felt like eons, but the spark never dwindles. 

We meet on high-chairs at a dimly lit bar, we meet at the beaches, we meet when nobody‚Äôs around and even more when everybody‚Äôs watching. 

I haven‚Äôt known a better love. 
Me and my words against the world, or maybe just in it. 


P.S I got this tattoo at 18 when I decided I‚Äôd be nothing but a writer (which meant I‚Äôd be a lot at once). The ink‚Äôs old, the design‚Äôs shabby, but it says ‚ÄúI write my own universe‚Äù.

We witnessed talent turn latent and applauded Ewtubers for their quick success. We gave medals to the tiktok dancers and trends to performers. 

We scrolled to the doomsday watching people school us on how to look prettier, how to get richer, how to become smarter. 

We liked, shared, subscribed to mediocrity. We witnessed frivolity and crassness and gave it the title of ‚Äòcool‚Äô and ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô and ‚Äòreal‚Äô. Real problem. 

We defended the rebel kids for their unhinged vagaries until we hinged on their absurdity. We brought fame to their lives, insecurities to ours. 

We murdered poets, they‚Äôre all dead in the society. We put our kids on the internet at the cost of their naivety, all for an adult‚Äôs entertainment. 

We buried the written-word, we chopped squat our attention spans. We read more tips and tricks than books and biographies. 

We watched what they ate in a day, what they have in their bags. We ate up the most expensive chunk of our time, we bulked up our emotional baggage.

A question that will grate on you as soon as you touch 25, even sooner if you‚Äôre a woman. 

Having spent a lot of time alone and losing people to the ultimate climax of life, my aspiration was to have a fuller family. The kind of family where weddings are never intimate, because you know over 150 relatives by their names. 

I wanted to have a home, a husband, a kid, another kid for my first, a living room that looks like a night-club on a Diwali evening. In the most quintessential fashion, I wanted a ‚Äòsettled life‚Äô. 

And why shouldn‚Äôt one have that aspiration? Independence and togetherness co-exist, freedom and tradition can work in conjunction. I want whatever‚Äôs in my stars, and connect the dots to make it a goddamn constellation. 

But do you know what a settled life really is? When two or five, the family is full at all times. When you‚Äôve found a living-room big enough for your time of leisure. When you have the emotional bandwidth to love a being, and a healthy body to birth one. 

When you have the choice to have all or none of that. All or none, YOUR CHOICE. 

The best relationship I‚Äôll ever have is with myself, and everything else will be a bigggg heftyyyy bonus. Is that bonus still my aspiration? Hell to the yes. It‚Äôs a choice I want to deliberately and ardently make. 

I want to have a home, a husband, a kid, another kid for my first, a living room that looks like a night club on a Diwali evening. But first, I want a settled life. 

I‚Äôm on it.

When I was in school, I‚Äôd see life on psychedelics after a sick leave. Every teacher‚Äôs wicked smile jeered at my absent note, and their black bindis, a subtle symbolism of my dark future. 

My classmates laughed louder, ridiculed me, they knew I was behind fifteen pages of notes. The school assembly theme was ‚Äòdiscipline is destiny‚Äô, do they know I was missing for a week? 

College? A bigger disaster. I would forget the way to my canteen from my classroom. Was it left, or right, am I still a part of the possie I gained entry to? 

I‚Äôve been missing for far too long to have best friends, or any friends at all. The girl who generously gave me her scrunchie on the first day just walked past. Four days out of sight, forever out of mind. Dumb, Shailya! 

If I don‚Äôt touch my laptop all weekend, I‚Äôll play out a dialogue in my head word by word. The one between my existing client and their new writer. 

Should‚Äôve just taken my laptop to the bar, should‚Äôve picked the call in the third ring. Was I sick for the second time this month? She‚Äôs laden with viruses, more severely with that of incompetence. 

The qualms have steadied with age and experience, the shame has taken a backseat. But the nerves? Still there. Every single time. 

The only place that doesn‚Äôt make me nervous after a break is this one. You all. 

I could disappear for a week and still be welcomed with a ‚ÄúI missed you‚Äù from someone I‚Äôve never met. I get love in the same numbers and magnitude. I am hugged with the same warmth, no questions asked. 

And for that, I‚Äôm grateful beyond words. I‚Äôve broken every possible LinkedIn rule. That of consistency and engagement and visibility. 

But honesty? Never. 
And you‚Äôve appreciated every bit of it selflessly.

If not in the middle of a farm with a mandolin, then at my doorstep with flowers. Always ready to love, always ready to rescue me. 

You can‚Äôt blame me now, can you? I have deep daddy issues that I seldom talk about, and I‚Äôve grown up watching movies where men always trudge the extra mile. 

And then I met a man who needed a little more love than I did. He wasn‚Äôt broken, just not familiar with the grandeur of romance. Always a little hesitant, always a little shy. We call it the ‚Äòbare minimum‚Äô at our own convenience. 

Totally capable of building me a garden of flowers, but just didn‚Äôt know when and how to. At first, I was mad. Why am I not being rescued? Why am I the more vehement lover? 

Those godforsaken romantic movies, I tell you. Hugh Grant and Richard Gare spoiled me. They fed me unrealistic dreams. 

I‚Äôm better informed now. I know love is not all fireworks, and relationships are never 50-50. Sometimes the man‚Äôs a 70, and sometimes the woman. 

We can love in our own capacity, and yet abundantly. So who am I to say that I am the more vehement lover, when someone‚Äôs diffident love is their 150%? 

And why should I wait until I find someone whose 100% is as loud, unabashed, and dramatic as mine? Why can I not love more the person I want to love? I‚Äôm strong, I‚Äôm independent, I have degree in romantic gestures. 

What if..I am the Raj? And why doesn‚Äôt he deserve a Raj like me?

Waking up on the fifth snooze, working from home for the 3rd week of the month, all cameras off on a zoom call. 

Doing the known, talking to the familiar. Sauce pans are heavier than paper bags, and we no longer saut√©, we have it all sorted. 10 mins away, just blink it. 

We want our kind of coffee on our side of the bed, pillows fluffed, books half-read, diaries painted with griffonage. Maps should drop me off at the doorstep of a cafe. 

You know what‚Äôs the worst part about your comfort zone? It makes you too comfortable. No plot-twists, no fears, no hikes, nothing to conquer today. 

Last month, all I did was step out of my comfort zone. 

I worked for 12 hour a day for seven days a week. 
I booked a flight 6 hours before I was supposed to catch it. 
I cooked two meals of my day; always ordered the last. 
I read fiction, it was all vague and all consumed. 
I talked to unfamiliar faces, went to unknown places. 
I took up the projects I‚Äôm not a ninja-master at. 
I stepped away from social media, I became more social. 
I wrote on the hardest day of writing; you‚Äôre reading it now. 

No, I‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôll push myself out of my comfort zone every day. I want to live more, not barely. 

But man-o-man, the comfort zone! It needs to be shown its place every once in a while.

I would wake up before my morning alarm. 
Take a shower, let half my tresses air-dry, and then came the straightening wand. 
Wet hair sandwiched between a ssssssound, which was always more bearable than my lousy curls.

By 14, I was a fully grown woman.
I bled more blood than my body could make, 
So my lips were always pale, grey, ashy. Nothing like a woman‚Äôs lips in poems. 
Slathered a nivea tinted lipbalm, a fortune above my pocket-money, but still more affordable than my weary appeal. 

At 17, the greater part of my closet was black.
I handpicked darkness, because it is meant to make your waist look small. Tiny. Petite. Worthy of an embrace. 
Starved myself a day before the famous girl‚Äôs birthday party, but still fuller in confidence than on days I ate well. 

At 20, I read more non-fiction than ever. 
I would keep my paradoxes and thrillers on the bottom shelf. Women are beautiful AND smart. 
Witty, well-learned, well-spoken, well-mannered. 
Watched the movies I didn‚Äôt like, but was still more entertained than I was with my own character. 

Now that I am 25, 
I color my hair every year in a different shade of brown, and fix them only on Saturdays. 
I go for morning walks straight out of bed. Bare lips, lousy waves, pimple patches from a night before. 
I wear pink, blue, orange, sssssilver, golden, parrot-green, all-coloured prints. 
I read stories, I live stories, I write stories. 

I write stories.

I‚Äôve turned pages after pages until they turned yellow. I‚Äôve met strong women, independent women, soft women, proud women, confident women. 

And then there‚Äôs this one. She‚Äôs Parveen. 

Parveen takes care of a sizeable family. Two daughters, one newly married. A son who likes his hoodies fresh. A husband who is the biological father to one, step to the others. 

We‚Äôve lustily suggested a small vacation to her, but she‚Äôs always on duty. From one home to another, her scope of work is more agile than what my contracts read. 

If today she‚Äôs having trouble with her landlord, tomorrow she‚Äôll aggressively calculate her son‚Äôs school fee. And mind you, before I met her, I thought my math was the most bizarre. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say she‚Äôs the only woman I‚Äôve seen grappling with the hurlies and burlies of life. But I‚Äôll tell you what fascinates me. 

Her smile. Her laughter. Her curiosity. Her intelligence. Her kindness. Her love. 

She could be having the worst day possible, but she‚Äôll gracefully knock my door to ask me why my lunch‚Äôs still sitting in the kitchen unattended. She jumps at an opportunity to learn a little more about her humble cellphone. 

When people are late to pay her, she would barely ever raise her voice. But, she‚Äôll pose a question that would strike your bone (if the heart has one). ‚ÄúWhy would someone, living in a big house, not pay a timely fee so that I can run my small house?‚Äù 

Sunny or cloudy, work or leisure, misery or glee - this woman smiles. 

She‚Äôs not our house-help. She‚Äôs our house manager. And God knows what I‚Äôd do without her. I‚Äôd cry in a corner and won‚Äôt stop until an external force hits me with happiness. Newton‚Äôs first law of emotion. 

I don‚Äôt smile on all days. But looking at her, sometimes, just sometimes, I want to.

A middle-class man cracks his 4th interview wearing the same crispy beige shirt. His mother splurges on barfi. 

A house-wife turned home-baker fulfils her first order with a butterscotch cake. Aakash gets a cricket bat for his birthday. 

A 20 year old who became a woman at 16 leaves trauma out of her boardroom meetings. Papa is planning retirement at 50. 

A first-generation engineer lands a job at one of the big four. Bade bhaiya can afford Priya‚Äôs wedding, and perhaps even some jewels. 

Who decides if someone has truly made it in their lives? Not the ones on the outside. 

You, me, the honest writer, the sincere teacher, the loyal corporate lancer, the founder, the smaller than small agency owner. 

All success stories.

Let‚Äôs do a solid 15 (peut √™tre?)! 

1. An obsession with independence can be self-inflicted misery. Dependency in moderation is a beautiful thing. Make friends, find love, go home. Humans don‚Äôt thrive as lone creatures. 

2. Passionate people will make you pity yourselves. If you had to drop yours for survival, chase it for pleasure. It‚Äôs a privilege to make it your vocation, it‚Äôs stupidity to surrender altogether. 

3. Comparison is inevitable. But next time you want someone‚Äôs life, make a list of things they gave up to achieve it. If these items are your non-negotiables, kick jealousy out. 

4. Nobody‚Äôs looking. Nobody remembers your fumbled words and wrinkled shirts. Don‚Äôt drop your self-esteem for that flash of a second someone takes notice of you. 

5. My world-view at 25 is not going to be the same as that at 35. Don‚Äôt be stubborn with your learnings. Change of heart, mind, and opinions. All beautiful things. 

6. One should have enough money to take themselves out of an unpleasant relationship, and enough self-love to enjoy a bus-ride alone. 

7. If you‚Äôre not happy with what you do, you won‚Äôt be happy with how you look. It‚Äôs not the weighing scale or your nose that you hate. It‚Äôs the lack of movement and procrastination that you despise. 

8. You‚Äôre not wiser than the next person you meet. See what you can take from people than measure how better or worse you are. None beneath or above, all come with lessons. 

9. You can wear modest clothes, hide your selfies, reject designer bags, skip makeup, write poetry, quit drinking without making someone else look bad. Choices don‚Äôt compete. 

10. Love will always escape you if you‚Äôre desperately looking for it. The universe will smell your desire and do everything to make you love yourself first. You‚Äôd rather start there. 

11. Disagree but with logic, with poise, with calm. Never to prove yourself right but to shed light on facts and myths, just and unjust. You‚Äôre not fighting a fight with the whole world. 

12. Ambition is not always position, influence, or wealth. It could be noble, slow, more often hidden from a scrollable social media feed. Don‚Äôt underplay it.

13. The more lies you tell people on the internet, the more lies you start believing about yourself. Praises will be louder than that inner voice telling you to improve. It‚Äôs sweet self-destruction. 

14. Faking success is bad, but faking emotional intelligence is degeneration! Admit it when you realise you don‚Äôt know better, and ask for help. Seeming mature isn‚Äôt better than wetting pillows at night. 

15. Nothing, absolutely nothing tastes better than how healthy feels. It‚Äôs a lone battle for the sharp mind to fight with a feeble body. 

16. Just when you think you can do one more shot before the night ends, just don‚Äôt. Save your gut, remember your night, mind your step. Just don‚Äôt do that last shot.

It‚Äôs a heavy cross to bear. 

He is..mama. 
If my grandfather took the role of my father, my mama (uncle) was my bro, my pal, my buddy. 

His body was ridden with Parkinson‚Äôs, a disease that slows down your corporeal functions to a fast-paced demise. 

His brain had a condition of its own, as if it wanted to compete with his body. Though a 45 year old, he couldn‚Äôt get wiser than a pre-teen. 

And since I was the youngest in the house, we were pals, bros, buddies. We shared candies, kites, knick knacks from the weekly rummage sale. He had a thing for rings and wallets. 

We shared everything but blue-lays. I‚Äôm not sure why, but I always hid that deep-fried, spice-laden, curse of a snack from him. Greed, I tell you. 

I was growing up, beyond years on most days, but with my age on others. The older I got, the younger and feebler he looked. Body of a 70 year old at 45, but brain stuck at 15. 

And one day, just like that, he was gone. 
I found myself outside a ‚Äòshamshaan ghaat‚Äô in my hometown, the forbidden ground for young women as superstition says. 

It wasn‚Äôt my first meeting with loss. And man, what a big fat lie, this life! We are convinced of its grandeur when only love and kindness are for keeps past the forbidden grounds. 

He was all love and kindness. It‚Äôs everything he left me with. That and a few regrets.

I wish I had flown more kites with him. 
I wish I got him more rings and wallets.
I wish I had shared that damned blue lays. 

Whoever said time is money is a fool. Money may come back, but time? Time will keep you wishing. You‚Äôd rather fight the world to share your time with those who matter. 

Call them, tell them you love them and be awfully loud, buy more wallets or rings or whatever makes their toes tap. 

Do yourself a favour and share your time.

For the initial 14 years of my life, she was slightly busy building the home we have now after all these years. But, she was never absent. 

If I sit her down to tell her what she did for me, you‚Äôll see the working-mom guilt crawling up her veins. 

It‚Äôs her birthday today, and I could have penned this on a crisp paper. But since she hits refresh on my feed every day, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll read it. 

You got me my first ever princess-themed school bag. 
You told me I was invincible when I fell off my three-wheeled bicycle. 
You pulled off a John Galliano on my costume for the first annual function dance. 
You sat in the front row, grinning wide, when I became the cultural minister of my school. 
You drew flags (upside down), moustaches, and whiskers on my face for theatrics. 
You got me my first roller skates, those with pink buckles on them. 
You gave me a tender lecture on choices when a guy broke my heart for the first time. 
You got me the QWERTY of my dreams, took trips to the cyber cafe but placed a CPU on my desk. 
You could miss the world‚Äôs most important affairs but never a PTA meeting.
You never dropped your smile after perusing a report-card. 
You bought me an activa and spent eight long evenings teaching me how to ride it. 
You filled my wardrobe. With clothes warm, clothes absurd, clothes colorful. 
You took me on a no-budget shopping spree before my prom. I picked the most beautiful dress I had ever seen. 
You believed in me when I gave you the crazy idea of me being a writer, you still do. 

You were there. You were present. You didn‚Äôt miss out. While kids went gaga over the supers and irons of men, I watched you. My hero.

And who hasn‚Äôt ever been? I can tell you all about my foiled tries. I would wear the thickest layer of mystery and stare into eyes with a poker face. 

I didn‚Äôt love pink, but I pretended to loathe pink. The color was too bright, too in-your-face, too girly. How does a forewoman of spine wear pink without shame?! 

I shook my head from side to side in disapproval of a certain vodka, because whiskey is a man‚Äôs drink. And the woman who can down a man‚Äôs drink is a stronger woman. 

Partly because I wanted to be likeable, and partly because I grew up too soon. I was competing not just for attention, but with a world years ahead of me. 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs different, she‚Äôs intellectual. She reads non-fiction and wears a blazer on Fridays. She‚Äôs not like other girls, you know..‚Äù 

Well, too bad! I am exactly like other girls. Headstrong, heart on my sleeves, fingers dripping gold in love, kindness on the lips. I‚Äôm so much like her. 

Nobody picks you, woman. You pick and choose your life. Lay it on a work-desk, decorate it in your catharsis-corner, take it to your boardroom meetings. YOU PICK AND CHOOSE YOUR LIFE. 

Now I meet people with a smile so big that my face hurts. I don‚Äôt wear a modicum of mystery. Whatever there is to be known about me, is made known. 

Now it‚Äôs me and my pink things against the world.

Thousands of photos, videos, and screenshots. 51 sentenced. Punishment? Still lenient. 

Trigger warning: sexual abuse, content deemed ‚Äòinappropriate‚Äô for Linkedin. 

Gisele Pelicot is brave. Fierce. Shame has indeed switched sides after her relentless fight. 

Despite a pool of evidence, if a woman had to face the defendants, waive her right to anonymity, and play horrific videos in the courthouse..

I wonder what makes women confess years after the assault. I wonder why don‚Äôt they just file a complaint instead of blabbering on the internet. 

Would you still believe me if I said many of us take a long time to just process that we were violated? 

Gisele was on sale for over a decade, on an app called √† son insu. Translation? Without her knowledge. WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE. 

A 44 year old supermarket worker, father of three. 
A 74 year old retired fire fighter, father of two. 
A 27 year old solider, who revealed in the trial that he missed his daughter‚Äôs birth because he was committing a heinous crime. 

The list is long. She stood in the courthouse nodding her head to every name as the verdicts were announced. 3 years in jail, 5 years in jail, 15 years in jail - for scarring women infinitely. 

This fight is going to be as long as we make it. 
Shame has to switch sides.

He brought home the second TV that he deserved, because the first had played daily soaps and news channels on repeat for a decade. Something for mom, something for dad, nothing for him. Now he has learnt to not mind the look he gets when he reveals how inaccessible was Harry Potter to him. 

We don‚Äôt acknowledge the small privileges, do we? The privilege of information, the privilege of cultural education, the privilege of having parents who read and pass on their treasure of books, the privilege of having pop-culture on our fingertips. 

One would think kindness is giving. Do you know what else is kindness? Involving. 

Next time you meet someone who has never heard a classic song, play something to their taste. 

Next time you meet someone who feels out of place, show them just how clumsy you are with your cues. 

Next time you meet someone who has never watched your favourite movie, tell them how you wish you could see it for the first time again, and they get to. 

Make people feel involved. There‚Äôs already enough FOMO in this world.

It almost always starts with imitation. You read something you like so much that it hurts to not have penned it before a Dostoevsky did. 

You pick songs, you pick words. You string words together, you make songs. You look for the sweetest sounding synonym for a stale (a synonym for boring) word. 

You realise that on one sombre evening with an unsociable friend, when you run out of tonic for your gin, it makes more sense to say ‚Äòboring‚Äô than ‚Äòstale‚Äô. 

You say big words in small poems. You find a lesser-known writer on the internet, drool over their turn of phrase, wonder when it‚Äôll be your turn to become the writer you want to be. 

I‚Äôve done this for almost a decade before I found ‚Äòmy voice‚Äô. And, what was it? What was my voice? How is it mine when I have learnt from what I have read?

The words you savour decide how you write, but the life you live decides what you write. 

And the ‚Äòwhat‚Äô is what makes you unique. The ‚Äòwhat‚Äô comes from a small chat with your heroes, a hike with strangers, a coffee with a filthy rich man who is underdressed for a party. 

It comes from friendships, from love. From how you treat a junior at work, from whoever you extend your helping hand to. It comes from the kirana store uncle who quietly writes shayaris on the last page of his diaries. 

Mind you, the ‚Äòwhat‚Äô evolves with time and age and places. So does your writing. Evolution and growth are beautiful to witness. Caterpillars are as wondrous as butterflies. 

Be envious, be aspirational. But don‚Äôt try to copy at 25 what you read from a writer in his 50s. When one tries to achieve what they haven‚Äôt lived, they grow more doubts than creativity. 

Your voice is what you are NOW. In this very moment.

This picture is from my first ever birthday, and I reckon it looks like a happy one. Smile so wide, you can barely see the twinkle in my eyes. 

I often speak about being a loved child. I was my grandparents‚Äô second chance at having their first daughter. I was my mother‚Äôs universe. My uncle came to blows with the world every other day to protect my twinkle. 

But the day of my birth was all but rosy. Heck, I‚Äôd say it looked like a crime scene. My mother, a felon for bringing home a girl-child. You‚Äôd wonder why the year 2000 was lagging. Unfortunately, a small town is a decade behind metro cities. 

She was in an abusive, precarious marriage. And to make it worse, she had just popped out a girl for a Brahmin family in the smallest corner of Uttarkashi. Felon, she!

My first cry wasn‚Äôt my cry alone. Everybody in the labour room weeped. My father refused to celebrate. My paternal aunt, however, was kind enough to embrace a 23-year young mother and bring the tiniest dabba of besan ke laddoo for the hospital staff. 

I believe that was the day when my mother decided that she could compromise on a married life, but not on the life she had just created. A couple of months passed before she walked out. Took the blue pram that she had revolted for and never looked back. 

A young mother, in the middle of a divorce, in a backward society, with little to no money and far from a job- she wanted to celebrate my first birthday. Oof, the strength! If I had half of it, I would have been a pretty big deal today.

She could afford only four big balloons, a make-shift cake, and a kodak film that developed twenty negatives at a time. It was a party of three. My mother, my grandmother, and an absolutely clueless but very jolly Shailya. 

Ever since that day, I‚Äôve been told that I am a blessing. Owing to the position of women in the society, my mother was titled ‚Äòghar ka beta‚Äô. And me? I was then, and am, the very loved ‚Äòghar ki beti‚Äô. 

My birthday is 40 days away, and I am beyond excited for it. If my creator had the heart and gall to celebrate me in the darkest of days, how dare I?! 

How dare I treat my birthday like it‚Äôs just another day?

Says a woman who always storms into rooms, never glides. Dressed to the nines, the posture of an Aphrodite, a jading smile, world on her shoulders. 

The narrative is a winner. When Pussycat Dolls said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a man‚Äù, a whole generation of women felt empowered. The idea was to remind us that we don‚Äôt NEED a man, and they don‚Äôt come wearing the key to your happiness around their necks. 

But what about..wanting a man? Does it make you a fragile woman? Incomplete? Dressed down, hunched back, overwhelming grin, in a world far beyond the reach of your delicate hands? 

Yesterday when a girlfriend expressed her strong desire to get married now that she‚Äôs 29, another friend acknowledged her and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a man!‚Äù. Almost dismissing her fairytale, she made her feel like love and dependence were beneath her.

I‚Äôve been raised by a mother who also played the role of a father, became the sole bread-winner of the family. Generational wealth of a woman, this one. Having her in the next room every day since the age of 14, I can tell you that I know a lot about not NEEDING a man. 

What you NEED is health, a sound mind, enough money to survive and then to live some, and Woolf would insist on a room of one‚Äôs own. But if you want a man, do not let anyone tell you that you‚Äôre not as strong and independent.

Ah, God knows I want a man! I‚Äôve seen what he brings home. I‚Äôve seen him work round the clock to build a home for his woman. I‚Äôve seen girl-dads and weeping grooms and that one lost boyfriend in a superstore struggling to tell a pad from a tampon. I have no reason to not want a man. 

One thing I have realised after hearing a gazillion stories is that love is a matter of luck. Some find it early, some never do. Some lose it midway, some take it to their grave. 

Keeping that in mind, you should know that you don‚Äôt NEED. 
But if you WANT, I wish you a fairytale.

There‚Äôs nothing that I love more than scribbling every little detail of my life to share it with strangers on the internet.

Nothing. 

I may be tempted to warn her about a particular doll-faced boy, 
but I‚Äôd let her learn what‚Äôs not love. 

I‚Äôd let silence sit on her mouth while a bully mocks her innocence, 
so that her sock-knocking self thrives but in kindness. 

I‚Äôd let her straighten her hair every morning for school, 
before the bounce in her walk can compete with that in her curls. 

I‚Äôd let her hate her body, make black her favourite color, eat lipsticks in her weight, 
until she learns how to smile at her beauty with her bare lips. 

I‚Äôd let her sit on her pen and find her sword in this haystack of a world, 
so that when she meets her craft, she knows what to owe her life to. 

I‚Äôd let her say something stupid on stage and fumble in an interview, 
I‚Äôd let her cry, fail, stumble, mourn, cheat, lay next to hopelessness in bed. 

I‚Äôd let her make cards for people who‚Äôll later break her a little,
I‚Äôd let her make the same mistake again so that there‚Äôs never a third time. 

I‚Äôd let her miss a call from someone she‚Äôs never going to see again, 
so that she knows just how out of her control life is, and why you should take some calls in a heartbeat. 

And oh would I desperately want to whisper in her ear that she‚Äôll solve half her problems if she 
believes in herself 
wears her heart on her sleeve
stops listening to someone else‚Äôs favourite songs 
can avoid being annoyingly scared way before something becomes scary

Every time I say it out loud, I think in minutes, in hours, in days, in phases. 

One year of hold on that gluttonous tongue. 
Six months of grind and life will be kingly again.
Just 10,000 steps, four days a week. 
Five hours of focus work and fifteen minutes of journaling. 
Deep breathing for 30 seconds. More out than in. 

Perhaps I‚Äôll get a grip on my cutlass after I recover from 
this breakup, 
that friendship, 
those times. 

The problem with ‚ÄúI WILL work on myself‚Äù is that you start looking at life as one big assignment. 
Daunting and haunting. An abiding moratorium cuddles with you in bed. 
You sit on everything. Not just work, body, or soul. Everything! 

The good thing about ‚ÄúI AM working on myself‚Äù is that you start looking at life in subjects. 
Doable and palatable. Today becomes your first and last day. 
You do a little for your soul, a little for your body, a little for the living. 

On any other Monday, I would make big plans. Of conquering the world, of holding life by its lapels and giving it all the answers I prepared in the shower yesterday. Of resting in nature‚Äôs arms and gobbling books up. Of looking prettier than how I was born. Of reigning. 

But today, I woke up at a Godly hour. 
I made my bed and fluffed my pillows and bathed in cold water. 
I brushed my teeth for 2 minutes and moisturised.
I had eggs for breakfast, newspaper for fodder. 
I made a small, humble to-do list. 
I stretched. Not beyond my capacity. Just a wee bit on the yoga mat. 
I thought. I am thinking. I‚Äôll think more.

For the longest time, I thought home is familiarity. Muscle memory. 
When you‚Äôve learned about the best spot to hide your keys under. 
You know exactly how many turns and pushes it takes to unlock the door. 
You know which broken cupboard takes tenderness before it comes tumbling down on your head. 
You know your favourite corner, where your favourite beverage changes from tea to cucumber-flavoured water. 
You know which particular light to turn on a good day. You know the chairs that catch the most dust. 

And one day, you pack all of it in cardboard boxes and move out. Keys packed in an envelope. Cupboards left uncovered. 

Temporary homes are still homes. 
But last year, when we moved into our first permanent home, I understood what a home really is. 
It‚Äôs your state of mind, your healing heart, your recovering self-esteem, your dwindling insecurities. 
It‚Äôs acceptance. Of change, the transience of joy and sorrow, the stillness of your being that is usually accompanied by frequent back aches. 

Every year since 2018, my mother and I would pack our bags on Diwali. 
As our family kept getting smaller, festivals felt lonelier. 
So we‚Äôd take off to Amritsar and celebrate with thousands and thousands of people at the Golden Temple. 
But this time, we‚Äôve decided to stay home. Not because it‚Äôs permanent. 
Because we‚Äôre in a better place. Our heart is as lit up as the city. 
We‚Äôre enough. 

This time, 
We‚Äôll put fairly lights in the balcony.
We‚Äôll light diyas at the doorstep. 
We‚Äôll lay a rangoli in the living room. 
We‚Äôll keep our windows open for all the Gods and Goddesses in the world. 

We‚Äôll be at home.

Huff and puff. Let‚Äôs talk about this. 

If you think living with your family is a privilege, you don‚Äôt acknowledge that having packed your life in two suitcases to be your own person is another privilege. 

While one races out to take their own responsibility, the other stays put because their family IS their responsibility. 

Might I say, and quite insistently so, that one must pay their own bills and repair their own nest. Cook their own meals and salvage their own pennies. 

I appreciate the gall it takes to take to leave everything behind and start a life in a new city. But being responsible only for yourself is also a privilege. 

Forget privilege. 

Some people need a hearty co-existence. They live for people. Their dinner table conversations are their fuel. They love to come back home to love and blessings. 

‚ÄúJis ghar mein buzurg hota hain, us ghar mein barkat hoti hai‚Äù. Old school, I guess? But don‚Äôt shame people for still believing in it. 

The most dangerous thing on the internet is life advice from one twenty something to other twenty somethings. 

Share your life experiences. Let your old opinions quarrel with the newer ones. Let time change how you look at the withered faces of your parents and their parents. 

Let years do their job and shackle your impulses. Let money prove itself inane, let independence part ways with egoistic solitude. Let life do its own thing..

before you take or give stupid life advice. Life is so different for you than for the person you‚Äôre yet to meet today. 

Some questions come with multiple choices, and no matter what box you tick, it‚Äôs the right answer if it is right FOR YOU.  :)
