 but only after fixing one thing: our pitch deck.

The Backstory :

Our first deck was a mess.

15+ slides. Too much jargon. Zero story.

Investors nodded politely.
Grant reviewers skimmed and moved on.

We thought we had a funding problem.
Turns out, we had a storytelling problem.

The Turning Point: 

So I went deep.
I studied Airbnb’s original 2008 deck, Uber’s scrappy pitch, Facebook’s first slides, and more.

I mapped out the patterns, the mistakes, the formulas that actually got funded.

Then we rebuilt our pitch deck from scratch.
This time it clicked.

That one change helped us unlock a ₹10 lakh grant that powered our early growth.

Razorpay, the startup that has quietly powered the backbone of India’s digital commerce for a decade

At the Global Fintech Fest 2025, they unveiled 'Agentic Payments'.
India’s first AI-powered payment system that lets you shop directly inside ChatGPT.

- No app switching.
- No PIN entry.
- No friction.

Built in partnership with National Payments Corporation Of India (NPCI) and OpenAI, it uses innovations like UPI Reserve Pay (to pre-block funds for future purchases) and UPI Circle (to delegate authentication to your AI assistant).

You set your spending limits.
Your AI handles the rest.

For now, it’s live with bigbasket and Vi (Vodafone), built on airtel and Axis Bank’s infra,
but the bigger story is what’s next. Razorpay is already testing Gemini and Claude integrations.

That means your AI assistant could soon talk, decide, and pay across any app or platform!

This isn’t just a product launch.

It’s the start of autonomous AI commerce, where transactions happen at the speed of conversation.

No, this isn’t a fancy hook. This actually happened last week at GFF, and it’s a story.

I know for most of you this might sound funny or just weird, but for me, meeting someone like VSS was that important, not to have a transaction of any sort, but maybe to convince myself that all my heroes are very similar to me, and that I can surely be where they are someday.

After the flashy launch of Paytm’s new AI Soundbox (which deserves its own post), my co-founder Pratham and I decided to catch Shankar Mahadevan’s show for a bit.

Halfway through, we left the show and we were heading to a mixer nearby, but before that, a natural pit stop, the restroom.

I’m barely getting started when I hear Pratham Shankwalker yelling my name from the door.

And I’m like, “Bro, what now?!”

I rushed out, and the moment our eyes met, he goes, “Vijay Shekhar Sharma is here…”

And immediately turns to a guy nearby asking, “Kya ye vahi hai kya?”

I didn’t even think twice. Quickly washed my hands, wiped them dry, and sprinted out.

Thankfully, he was still there people around clicking pictures, a small crowd forming.

We waited our turn, and when it came, all I said was, “Big fan of you, sir. It’s amazing how you’re still involved in product decisions at Paytm at this scale. Keep inspiring us.”

That’s it.

No pitch. No name drop. No “we’re building this startup” moment.

Just pure fan energy.

Because honestly, I’ve always seen VSS as the guy who started the UPI movement, the one who made QR payments mainstream. Maybe not the only contributor, but definitely one of the most significant ones.

And I’m genuinely a huge fan of Product CEOs building things at that scale. I’m very much aware of things like ""the Product CEO Paradox"" and it takes a massive amount of effort, bandwidth, and invisible work to actually maintain that kind of growth.

For me, a 23-year-old guy from Bicholim (a small town in Goa), meeting VSS was a big deal.

Bengaluru ranks #5 globally among AI-focused startup cities,
It’s also #26 in the Global AI City Index 2025!

Anthropic, the US-based team behind Claude, one of the world’s leading AI models, is betting on that potential.

And, here’s why it matters:
Talent density: Bengaluru’s massive GCC (Global Capability Center) network gives Anthropic immediate access to world-class engineers, researchers, and data talent.

Policy tailwinds: Karnataka’s Startup Policy now offers grant-in-aid for DeepTech founders, alongside new skilling initiatives and the LEAP program to accelerate AI R&D.

Ecosystem maturity: The city’s startup ecosystem may rank #14, but it punches far above its weight in AI innovation and research output.

Chess players are analytical thinkers, early adopters, and exactly the demographic that values AI-powered tools.

you know AI might be repeating history.

I was born during the dot com bubble

but I still remember the stories I have heard
Everyone was pouring money into “the internet.”
And then, overnight, billions vanished.

Sam Altman says AI today feels similar.
Too much hype, too much capital, too fast.

He even admitted many people will lose their shirts in this wave.

But then comes Zuckerberg.
And his take surprised me.

He agrees it’s a bubble.

But he justifies Meta’s billions in AI R&D with one line:
“If we end up misspending, it will still be on building the future.”

That’s conviction.
Because here’s the reality:

Some startups will die.
Some investors will lose.

But the infrastructure, models, and breakthroughs left behind… will fuel the next decade.

Just like the dot-com crash didn’t kill the internet.
It actually cleared the noise for Amazon, Google, and Facebook to rise.

And that’s the paradox of bubbles:
They destroy, but they also create.

As founders, we’re stuck in the middle.
Do you risk riding the bubble?
Or do you play safe and wait for the dust to settle?

For me, the lesson is simple:
If you’re building, don’t just chase the hype.
Build for the inevitable world after the bubble bursts.

Because that’s where the real giants are born.

I see it as a map. Because if you know the map, you can drive faster and avoid crashing into walls you didn’t even know were there.

Last month, I got pulled into a debate:
 One side: “AGI is inevitable—nothing can stop it.”
 Other side: “Any legislation will kill the industry.”

Both sound strong… but both are wrong.

Here’s the reality:

- Europe: AI Act bans untargeted biometric scraping, classifies high-risk systems (health, hiring, credit, safety) for governance, logging, testing, and monitoring. Frontier models need evals and incident reporting.

- US: Executive guidance on red-teaming, watermarking, compute limits. FTC, CFPB, FDA enforcing against false claims, discrimination, unsafe systems. States like Colorado passing laws.

- UK, Canada, Japan: Standards-first, ISO 23894 & 42001 becoming the SOC 2 of AI.

- China: Real-name checks, provenance, watermarks, liability rules.

- India: Data protection + sector regulators. Enterprise buyers already demand proof of compliance.

What I think is, regulation won’t kill AI. Most rules just ask you to know your data, test your models, avoid harm, and prove it. And no “AGI inevitability” will save you if you fail risk reviews.

Smart guardrails are oxygen, not handcuffs. They make distribution smoother, reduce founder risk, and let you ship responsibly.

If you’re building AI, don’t wait for laws. Ship your product and proof it’s safe, fair, and fixable.

We like to believe disruption spares us.
That it’ll hit someone else first.

But last week, Altman was blunt:
Some jobs will absolutely be lost to AI.

It reminded me of a late-night chat I had with a founder friend.
He runs a 40-person support team.

And he told me,half joking-half serious
“If an AI could handle 60% of this, I’d cut half my team tomorrow.”

That was 2023.
While it did sound like distant future talk.
But today? It’s reality.

Customer service bots don’t sleep.
Data entry tools don’t make mistakes.
Workflows that once needed interns finish in seconds.

Altman wasn’t just painting a dystopia.
He also said entirely new categories of work will emerge.

Roles we can’t yet imagine,
just like “social media manager” didn’t exist in 2005.

The uncomfortable truth is this:
- The jobs that get automated vanish fast.
- The new ones take time to appear.

And the winners are those who retrain before the rest.

So maybe the question isn’t “Will AI take my job?”
It’s “Am I preparing for the jobs AI can’t touch yet?”

Because in the end, people won’t lose to AI.
They’ll lose to humans who know how to use it better.

A New Marketing Discipline is Being Born Right Now

Meta's announcement this week isn't just a policy update, it's signaling the emergence of an entirely new marketing specialization.

Which existed for last few months, but it will surely be raised to a different delta now.

We're witnessing the convergence of three critical domains:
- Conversational AI interactions (chatbots, voice assistants, AI tools)
- Performance marketing (ad targeting, ROAS optimization, audience segmentation)
- SEO principles (search intent, keyword optimization, content discoverability)

The role I see emerging something similar to AI Interaction Performance Optimizer.

Abit of performance marketer, abit of SEO guru, and a bit of therapist ;D

The core focus of this job role might look like, Optimize how brands show up in AI conversations, When users chat with Meta AI, ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google's AI tools about their needs, these specialists ensure brands get mentioned, recommended, and contextually positioned.

They'll combine:
- Understanding user intent in conversational queries (SEO thinking)
- Optimizing for AI-driven ad targeting based on chat interactions (performance marketing expertise)
- Creating content that AI systems reference and recommend (a completely new skill)

Meta has over 1 billion monthly users engaging with its AI tools. By mid-December, those conversations become targeting signals for ads. Google is adding ads to AI-powered search features. OpenAI is integrating shopping into ChatGPT.

The professionals sitting at an intersection of conversational AI interactions, search optimization, and paid media performance will be indispensable.

Traditional SEO optimized for Google's algorithms. 
Traditional performance marketers optimized for pixel data and click behavior.

This new role optimizes for how people naturally talk to AI and how that translates into visibility, recommendations, and conversions.

And 30,000 Zomato delivery partners signed up within just 72 hours.

Zomato partnered with HDFC Pension to launch the 'NPS Platform Workers Model', giving delivery partners access to structured retirement savings for the very first time.

Over 30,000 delivery partners signed up for their Permanent Retirement Account Numbers (PRANs) within the first 72 hours. This rapid adoption highlights the demand for accessible financial security at scale.

The government is also about to launch a new mandatory pension scheme requiring platform aggregators including Swiggy, Uber, Blinkit, and others to contribute 2% of each gig worker's earnings into their EPFO (Employee Provident Fund Organisation) accounts. Notably, this contribution is in addition to workers’ income and will not be deducted from their wages.

What this means:
- Worker retention will improve as platform work becomes sustainable long-term, not just temporary income
- Benefit portability across platforms via e-Shram means workers can switch between Zomato, Swiggy, and Uber without losing coverage
- Formalization of the sector with universal account numbers and better tracking
- Service costs may rise as platforms pass on pension expenses to consumers
- Implementation details matter, workers need assurance that take-home pay won't decrease

Currently, only 8% of gig workers have health insurance and less than 2% save for retirement. These schemes change that fundamentally.

September's record-breaking auto sales tell a fascinating story about Indian consumers one that goes far beyond festive euphoria.

When GST 2.0 slashed small car taxes from 31% to 18%, we didn't just see price cuts. We witnessed pent-up dreams suddenly becoming affordable. Tata Motors hit 60,907 units (up 47% YoY). Maruti's retail sales soared 27.5%. Hyundai recorded its highest-ever SUV contribution at 72.4%.

Yet the big question remains, Is this transformation or just a temporary spike?

History shows Indian consumers can quickly retreat when faced with:
- Job market uncertainty
- Inflationary pressures
- Policy instability
- Post-festive reality checks

The multiplier effects are real vehicles drive spending in insurance, fuel, servicing, and lifestyle upgrades. But sustaining this momentum requires more than tax cuts. It demands stable incomes, credit access, and continued policy confidence.

And the boardroom fight that cost them vision.

Back in 2015, when OpenAI first launched, it wasn’t a company.
It was a non-profit research lab.

Built on donations, not investments.

Infosys, under then-CEO Vishal Sikka, was one of the early backers.
But their contribution wasn’t $1B.

It was $1M.
A donation, not equity.

Here’s where it gets interesting.

Sikka was bullish on moonshots.
He wanted Infosys to bet on AI, Silicon Valley, and the future.

But Infosys’s founders weren’t aligned.
They wanted discipline, not experiments.
- The clashes grew public.
- Accusations flew.
- The board split.

And in 2017, Sikka resigned.
Infosys turned inward.
The big bets faded.

Two years later, OpenAI flipped its structure.
Microsoft wired in $1B and got a seat at the table, and Infosys?
It had no claim. Donations don’t turn into equity.

So the viral version,
“Infosys lost a $1B stake in OpenAI”, is false.

The real loss was bigger:
it lost the vision to play in that future.
Strategy dies when leadership alignment breaks.

Donations =/= ownership. Structure decides upside.

Sometimes, the cost of boardroom politics isn’t market cap.
It’s missing the next frontier.

Infosys didn’t miss out because it lacked foresight.
It missed out because it lacked alignment.

Have you ever watched internal politics cost a company the future?
I’d love to hear your example.

The core focus of this job role might look like, Optimize how brands show up in AI conversations, When users chat with Meta AI, ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google's AI tools about their needs, these specialists ensure brands get mentioned, recommended, and contextually positioned.

They'll combine:
- Understanding user intent in conversational queries (SEO thinking)
- Optimizing for AI-driven ad targeting based on chat interactions (performance marketing expertise)
- Creating content that AI systems reference and recommend (a completely new skill)

Meta has over 1 billion monthly users engaging with its AI tools. By mid-December, those conversations become targeting signals for ads. Google is adding ads to AI-powered search features. OpenAI is integrating shopping into ChatGPT.

The professionals sitting at an intersection of conversational AI interactions, search optimization, and paid media performance will be indispensable.

Traditional SEO optimized for Google's algorithms. 
Traditional performance marketers optimized for pixel data and click behavior.

This new role optimizes for how people naturally talk to AI and how that translates into visibility, recommendations, and conversions.

If you're deep in SEO or performance marketing, this is your evolution path. 

The brands that win in 2026 won't just rank in search they'll be the answers AI gives when users ask questions.",3,0,1,3w,Post,Siddharth Manjrekar,https://www.linkedin.com/in/thesidman,https://www.linkedin.com/in/thesidman/,2025-10-03T17:54:00.000Z,,2025-10-03T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-10-04

Thinking Machines Lab, just unveiled Tinker, a Python-based API that's democratizing access to advanced LLM fine-tuning.

Tinker eliminates the infrastructure headaches that typically plague AI researchers. Instead of wrestling with expensive GPU clusters and distributed computing systems, developers can write training loops on their laptops while Tinker handles the complex backend.

The platform supports 7+ open-source models including Meta's Llama and Alibaba's Qwen series, with the ability to switch from small models to massive mixture-of-experts systems.

Andrej Karpathy, Said that ""Tinker delivered around 90% of algorithmic control while alleviating approximately 90% of infrastructure challenges"". 

Which seems to be amazing, as I know what looks my devs give me, when I asked them to fine-tune a model if needed for one of the client.

And it might be the smartest move NPCI has ever made.

As of October 1, India's UPI ecosystem said goodbye to peer-to-peer ""collect requests."" 

For those who used it to split bills or nudge friends for payments, this feels like losing a convenience feature. But here's the reality: it was also costing people their hard-earned money.

Fraudsters loved the collect request. They'd pose as customer support, send fake payment requests disguised as refunds or prizes, and trick users into entering their UPI PIN thinking they were receiving money when they were actually sending it.

Now, all P2P payments must be user-initiated. The sender is in complete control, and that's a game-changer for digital trust.

Merchant collect requests also continue as usual, so your Amazon and Swiggy payments aren't going anywhere.

This move reinforces that India's digital payments infrastructure isn't just about speed and scale it's about building lasting trust.

A.R. Rahman x Sam Altman.

Two completely different worlds colliding.

On one side, Rahman,
India’s maestro of music.
Rooted in classical, philosophy, and a culture that often sees computers as spoilers of creativity.

On the other side, Altman,
the face of Silicon Valley’s AI revolution.
A man who believes AI won’t just assist creativity, it will redefine it.

And now… they’ve come together for Secret Mountain.
What is it?

An AI-powered musical metaverse.
A fantasy realm where music, immersive storytelling, and global cultures fuse into one world.

This isn’t just a project.
It’s a statement.

That technology and art don’t have to be enemies.
That AI can enhance the emotional depth of human creativity, not erase it.

Honestly, this gives me goosebumps.

Because it’s not just about Rahman or Altman.
It’s about showing a whole generation of Indian creators that you don’t have to choose between tradition and technology.

You can fuse them.

That’s Sora 2.

OpenAI just launched it.
And at first glance
It looks like “just another content app.""

But it’s not.

People mocked Sam Altman for this move.
“Why build TikTok clones instead of AGI?”

But Sam himself admitted it?
OpenAI needs to solve for money, they need to flex their research, and if they can put a smile on people’s faces while doing that, why not?

The bigger picture?

This is not about TikTok.
This is about the democratization of skill.

Before Instagram, you had to be a Photoshop expert to show your creativity.
Before YouTube, you had to be a full-blown video editor.

But now, with Sora
You just need English.

A prompt can replace hours of editing.
A sentence can replace years of technical skill.
This is not AI changing how humans interact.

It’s AI giving people power to express themselves without barriers.
The playing field is leveling.

The creative ceiling is no longer “what camera you own” or “what software you know.”

It’s only “what ideas you can think of.”
That’s why Sora 2 is insane.

It’s not just about videos.
It’s about removing the last friction between imagination and reality.

And that, to me, feels like a huge leap.

Microsoft recently launched their Ai copilot for Excel sheets, and they have been calling it ""vibe Working"".

Here’s what I’ve realized: it’s never really about the “vibe.” It’s about individuals who have taste a deep sense of what the outcome should feel like and a keen eye for nuance.

Ever since I started using AI, this has become obvious. I don’t have to do everything myself. I just review, guide, and refine. I tell AI what to do, point out what needs improvement, and the work gets done faster and better.

Now, I can’t do this with code I’m not a coder. But with product, marketing, and a few other areas I understand, this approach works like magic.

So yes, the word “vibe” might be overhyped but the era we’re entering? It’s for those with taste, vision, and the ability to guide work toward excellence.

I see it as a map. Because if you know the map, you can drive faster and avoid crashing into walls you didn’t even know were there.

Last month, I got pulled into a debate:
 One side: “AGI is inevitable—nothing can stop it.”
 Other side: “Any legislation will kill the industry.”

Both sound strong… but both are wrong.

Here’s the reality:

- Europe: AI Act bans untargeted biometric scraping, classifies high-risk systems (health, hiring, credit, safety) for governance, logging, testing, and monitoring. Frontier models need evals and incident reporting.

- US: Executive guidance on red-teaming, watermarking, compute limits. FTC, CFPB, FDA enforcing against false claims, discrimination, unsafe systems. States like Colorado passing laws.

- UK, Canada, Japan: Standards-first, ISO 23894 & 42001 becoming the SOC 2 of AI.

- China: Real-name checks, provenance, watermarks, liability rules.

- India: Data protection + sector regulators. Enterprise buyers already demand proof of compliance.

What I think is, regulation won’t kill AI. Most rules just ask you to know your data, test your models, avoid harm, and prove it. And no “AGI inevitability” will save you if you fail risk reviews.

Smart guardrails are oxygen, not handcuffs. They make distribution smoother, reduce founder risk, and let you ship responsibly.

If you’re building AI, don’t wait for laws. Ship your product and proof it’s safe, fair, and fixable.

But here’s the gap I keep seeing, they’re experimenting with tools, not strategy.

Their teams are deeply skilled in their own work, but often not in the possibilities of this market. And that’s where many miss out.

Because today, for an enterprise (or even a startup), AI isn’t just about cost savings or replacing employees.

It’s about survival.
It’s about hitting the new industry standard or risk being left behind.
And this doesn’t stop at enterprises.

Even many brilliant founders I’ve spoken to, people I deeply respect, often aren’t in the deepest context of what AI can actually do for them.

That’s where we’ve been thinking of a solution. 

We’re calling it, (yes, a little cringe maybe) Chief AI Officer as a Service 

But the idea is simple:
 - Sit with your teams.
 - Map all your workflows (phased, but eventually end-to-end).
 - Recommend the right AI tools, and build where needed.
 - Host them securely (on-prem, your cloud, or even edge devices).
 - Make sure the data stays yours, the control stays yours.

The unfair advantage?

You’re not just “using AI.” You’re building a system that keeps learning from your own data, workflows, and edge cases.

And over time, that becomes your moat.

That’s what Arattai, Sridhar Vembu’s homegrown messenger, just went through.

Most people would call this a “good problem.”
But anyone who has built consumer tech knows: this is the moment that makes or breaks you.

Because scaling isn’t just about adding servers.
It’s about scaling trust.

Exponential growth doesn’t just stress-test your infra.
It exposes your credibility.
Every dropped message, every failed call, every crash becomes a reason to churn.

And in messaging, the bar is unforgiving.
Users expect WhatsApp-grade reliability, Signal Messenger-grade privacy, and an experience that works seamlessly on budget Android phones and patchy 3G.

All while feeling native to India’s vernacular and social context.

That’s not a feature race.
That’s a credibility race.

If Arattai wants to win, the playbook is clear:

Reliability as UX -> Make uptime and latency visible. Ship a public status page and treat reliability as a feature.

Privacy with proofs -> Don’t sell promises, sell verifiable audits, protocols, and transparent data policies.

A wedge that matters -> Ultra-reliable family groups, crystal-clear low-bandwidth calls, or SME workflows tied to Zoho.

Exponential curves are brutal.
But surviving them builds a brand moat nothing else can.

India might finally have its shot at a truly credible alternative to WhatsApp.
The question is....
Can Arattai convert this viral spike into enduring trust?

4.1 changed that.
Suddenly, entire companies could build sustainable revenue streams powered by Claude.

safer, sharper, more reliable for B2B use.

Anthropic is doubling down on depth.

B2B APIs. Vibe-coding platforms. Content engines.
Infrastructure for businesses that actually pay.

Fun, but I love the version of Deepinder that talks about business, startups, tech, and life.

Because that version is genuinely smart, deeply passionate, and wildly ambitious.

Look at Zomato today:
It isn’t just competing with Swiggy.
It isn’t just competing with Zepto.
It isn't just competing with BookMyShow.

It’s building consumer experiences that span food, entertainment, and lifestyle.

They bought District the events platform from Paytm, bought groffers when it was hugely loss making and not strong enough as a product.

 Paytm had the scale, money, and distribution. Grofers was one of the earliest player in the market.

but both of them were not killer products.

I came across a story that really shook me.

Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA
A company now worth more than $2 trillion, is openly appealing to the US government.

Not about funding.
Not about regulation.
But about survival in a geopolitical war.

US has been tightening chip export rules to China.
Nvidia’s GPUs power almost every AI model being trained today.

China is its second-largest market.

If the restrictions continue,
Nvidia doesn’t just lose revenue, it risks losing the entire innovation loop that fuels AI progress.

“If we cut China off, they’ll just build their own ecosystem faster, and the US will lose influence.”

That’s rare honesty coming from a CEO of his scale.

To me, it’s a reminder of something we founders often forget:
Growth isn’t just about customers or product.

Sometimes, it’s about the larger forces you can’t control
Policy, politics, timing.

Nvidia built the world’s most critical AI hardware.
Yet even they are at the mercy of decisions made in Washington and Beijing.

As small builders, we complain about regulations or market shifts.
But look at Huang, he’s fighting battles 100x bigger, and still doubling down on execution.

The question I left with was simple:
How do we as founders design companies that can survive outside our control shocks?

Because if Nvidia is vulnerable, none of us are truly safe.

Curious to Know...
how do you future-proof your company when the biggest risks are geopolitical, not product-market fit?

you know AI might be repeating history.

I was born during the dot com bubble

but I still remember the stories I have heard
Everyone was pouring money into “the internet.”
And then, overnight, billions vanished.

Sam Altman says AI today feels similar.
Too much hype, too much capital, too fast.

He even admitted many people will lose their shirts in this wave.

But then comes Zuckerberg.
And his take surprised me.

He agrees it’s a bubble.

But he justifies Meta’s billions in AI R&D with one line:
“If we end up misspending, it will still be on building the future.”

That’s conviction.
Because here’s the reality:

Some startups will die.
Some investors will lose.

But the infrastructure, models, and breakthroughs left behind… will fuel the next decade.

Just like the dot-com crash didn’t kill the internet.
It actually cleared the noise for Amazon, Google, and Facebook to rise.

And that’s the paradox of bubbles:
They destroy, but they also create.

As founders, we’re stuck in the middle.
Do you risk riding the bubble?
Or do you play safe and wait for the dust to settle?

For me, the lesson is simple:
If you’re building, don’t just chase the hype.
Build for the inevitable world after the bubble bursts.

Because that’s where the real giants are born.

That’s almost half the world.

When I first joined Instagram, it was still about filters.
The square photos. The Valencia aesthetic.

And the promise of a new way to share your life.

Back then, nobody thought it would survive against Facebook or Snap Inc..
Yet here we are.

3 billion monthly active users.
- More than WhatsApp.
- More than TikTok.
- More than YouTube.

The crazy part?
This isn’t just scale. It’s power.

Because Instagram today isn’t just about scrolling.
- It’s the default discovery engine for Gen Z.
- It’s the marketplace for small businesses.
- It’s the top-of-funnel for creators.

And it’s the cultural stage for global conversations.

Every shift in how people communicate, buy, or express themselves has passed through Instagram.

Stories. Reels. DMs. Shops.
Each copied, tweaked, and expanded,
but Instagram made them mainstream.

So when Zuckerberg says:
“It’s a testament to how resilient Instagram is as a product”
He’s right.

The real lesson for us founders?
Longevity doesn’t come from one feature or one hype cycle.
It comes from constant reinvention while staying culturally relevant.

And that’s the paradox of building in tech:
You don’t just need product-market fit.
You need culture-platform fit.

Because if you don’t move with culture, you get left behind.

If you were building Instagram today,
what part of culture would you bet on?

A number so absurd people laughed it off… until Meta doubled down.

When Mark Zuckerberg made that $600B statement at the White House,
the room thought it was posturing.
Some even joked it was just him trying to flex under political pressure.

But Meta’s CFO (Susan Li) just clarified:
They’re dead serious.

The pledge isn’t a throwaway soundbite, it’s a commitment.
$600B to reshape America’s AI and compute future.

And here’s the wild part:
Most people underestimated how far Meta is willing to go.
- This isn’t just about chasing AI hype.
- It’s about buying a seat at the policy table.
- It’s about locking in compute access for the next decade.
- It’s about signaling to markets, governments, and rivals that Meta will not be second to OpenAI, Anthropic, or even NVIDIA.

Here’s the truth I took away:
What looks like “jokes” or “pressure talk” in the press…
Often turns out to be the first draft of a strategy no one else has the guts to say out loud.

Meta just showed us that.
And the ripple effects of a $600B promise will outlive the headlines.

Now the question isn’t whether Mark was serious.
It’s whether the rest of the ecosystem can keep up.

And the boardroom fight that cost them vision.

Back in 2015, when OpenAI first launched, it wasn’t a company.
It was a non-profit research lab.

Built on donations, not investments.

Infosys, under then-CEO Vishal Sikka, was one of the early backers.
But their contribution wasn’t $1B.

It was $1M.
A donation, not equity.

Here’s where it gets interesting.

Sikka was bullish on moonshots.
He wanted Infosys to bet on AI, Silicon Valley, and the future.

But Infosys’s founders weren’t aligned.
They wanted discipline, not experiments.
- The clashes grew public.
- Accusations flew.
- The board split.

And in 2017, Sikka resigned.
Infosys turned inward.
The big bets faded.

Two years later, OpenAI flipped its structure.
Microsoft wired in $1B and got a seat at the table, and Infosys?
It had no claim. Donations don’t turn into equity.

So the viral version,
“Infosys lost a $1B stake in OpenAI”, is false.

The real loss was bigger:
it lost the vision to play in that future.
Strategy dies when leadership alignment breaks.

Donations =/= ownership. Structure decides upside.

Sometimes, the cost of boardroom politics isn’t market cap.
It’s missing the next frontier.

Infosys didn’t miss out because it lacked foresight.
It missed out because it lacked alignment.

Have you ever watched internal politics cost a company the future?
I’d love to hear your example.

We like to believe disruption spares us.
That it’ll hit someone else first.

But last week, Altman was blunt:
Some jobs will absolutely be lost to AI.

It reminded me of a late-night chat I had with a founder friend.
He runs a 40-person support team.

And he told me,half joking-half serious
“If an AI could handle 60% of this, I’d cut half my team tomorrow.”

That was 2023.
While it did sound like distant future talk.
But today? It’s reality.

Customer service bots don’t sleep.
Data entry tools don’t make mistakes.
Workflows that once needed interns finish in seconds.

Altman wasn’t just painting a dystopia.
He also said entirely new categories of work will emerge.

Roles we can’t yet imagine,
just like “social media manager” didn’t exist in 2005.

The uncomfortable truth is this:
- The jobs that get automated vanish fast.
- The new ones take time to appear.

And the winners are those who retrain before the rest.

So maybe the question isn’t “Will AI take my job?”
It’s “Am I preparing for the jobs AI can’t touch yet?”

Because in the end, people won’t lose to AI.
They’ll lose to humans who know how to use it better.

Better models. Smarter researchers. Faster iteration.

He publicly thanked Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO.

Not for funding. Not for ideas.

Think about that.
The CEO of OpenAI arguably the most powerful AI lab on the planet.
Grateful just to get access to chips.

Because without NVIDIA’s GPUs,
- ChatGPT wouldn’t scale.
- Sora wouldn’t exist.
- OpenAI wouldn’t ship at speed.

This isn’t just partnership.
It’s dependency.

Jensen turned NVIDIA into the arms dealer of AI.
And even trillion-dollar companies are bottlenecked by supply.

The lesson?
For founders in AI, the risk isn’t just competition.
It’s survival.

So the real question isn’t: “Can you build it?”
It’s: “Can you run it at scale when everyone else wants the same GPUs?”

the Ultimate AI assistant.

But the real story isn’t what it can do. It’s what it destroys.
For years, founders have been building AI scheduling apps, note-takers, productivity bots.

Some raised millions.
Some even scaled to thousands of paying users.
Yesterday, most of them died.

Because Pulse isn’t just another The Sales Mind update.
It’s OpenAI’s first attempt to become the personal AI layer in your life.

Here’s what Pulse brings to the table:
- Memory: It doesn’t forget, it learns your preferences and context over time.
- Real-time data: News, flights, stocks, everything live.
- Cross-platform: Works across desktop and mobile, bridging email, calendar, apps.
- Voice + multimodal: Speak, show, type, it handles it all.

Sounds unbeatable, right?

But here’s the catch:
- It’s locked behind a $20/month Pro paywall.
- It doesn’t have the deep OS hooks of Siri or Microsoft Copilot.

And the privacy trade-off is huge!
Because “Always on” also means “always watching.”

Still, for most startups in AI productivity? This is game over.

Note-taking apps, meeting assistants, even some workflow bots?
Pulse will crush them by default.

Because here’s the brutal truth:
When the platform owner decides to enter, niche players rarely survive.

As a founder, it’s both terrifying and clarifying.
- Terrifying, because your moat can vanish overnight.
- Clarifying, because it forces you to build where distribution, trust, and depth of workflow really matter.

Pulse is the most powerful AI assistant we’ve seen yet.

But whether it becomes the default, or just another tool fighting ecosystem lock-in,
is the story to watch.

The real takeaway is not about GPUs or billion-dollar deals. It is about building flywheels where every transaction compounds future value.

Most founders focus on products and features. The best founders focus on systems and feedback loops.

Think about it:
- In markets, the loop is capital to valuation to reinvestment to more capital.
- In products, the loop is user to data to personalization to more users.
- In communities, the loop is content to engagement to visibility to more content.

The principle is the same everywhere: build circular systems that keep accelerating with each cycle.

If you are only shipping features, you are always sprinting.
If you are building loops, the sprint turns into momentum.

Because India doesn’t reward pure software plays.

We reward businesses that are operationally or compliance heavy
that’s why we see Zomato, Razorpay, Zepto thriving, not the next Google.

Here’s why I believe tech hasn’t taken off in India the way it should:

Late exposure: Most of us are introduced to tech way too late in life. Even though we have the world’s largest developer base, very few code because they love it.

Talent drain: The truly passionate ones are either working for Indian unicorns or have already left for the Valley.

Lack of ambition: We still obsess over instant profits and short-term returns. Burning cash to scale globally feels “wrong” here.

Mindset gap: We don’t play around with tech for fun. We build for survival, not to dent the universe.

And that’s why India often fails to build truly global, behavior-changing tech products.

Profitability is important
but obsession with quick returns kills ambition.

Facebook, Instagram, even Google were unprofitable for years.
Yet they changed the world and became massively valuable.

Being “dhanda-oriented” may build solid companies.
But it won’t build the ones that leave a mark on the planet.

Do you think India can ever build a truly global tech giant?

For most of my life, I was obsessed with control.
Plans, backups, structures—I wanted to be ready for every possible scenario.

But here’s what I’ve learned:
Perfection doesn’t matter if you’re not shipping.

Shipping the shittiest product on Day 5 and iterating until Day 30 will always beat launching your “perfect” product on Day 30.

Why? Because by Day 30, the polished product is already misaligned. No user feedback. No real-world iteration. Just assumptions.

On the other hand, shipping early lets you:
- Collect feedback fast.
- Test direction against real users.
- Iterate your way closer to product-market fit.

Startups don’t reward control.
They reward speed, iteration, and resilience.

The real moat isn’t a perfect plan
it’s the ability to ship, learn, and improve faster than anyone else.

For fellow founders:
Would you rather launch the “perfect” product late
or the “broken” product early and iterate your way to something great?

Because India doesn’t reward pure software plays.

We reward businesses that are operationally or compliance heavy
that’s why we see Zomato, Razorpay, Zepto thriving, not the next Google.

Here’s why I believe tech hasn’t taken off in India the way it should:

Late exposure: Most of us are introduced to tech way too late in life. Even though we have the world’s largest developer base, very few code because they love it.

Talent drain: The truly passionate ones are either working for Indian unicorns or have already left for the Valley.

Lack of ambition: We still obsess over instant profits and short-term returns. Burning cash to scale globally feels “wrong” here.

Mindset gap: We don’t play around with tech for fun. We build for survival, not to dent the universe.

And that’s why India often fails to build truly global, behavior-changing tech products.

Profitability is important
but obsession with quick returns kills ambition.

Facebook, Instagram, even Google were unprofitable for years.
Yet they changed the world and became massively valuable.

Being “dhanda-oriented” may build solid companies.
But it won’t build the ones that leave a mark on the planet.

Do you think India can ever build a truly global tech giant?
Or are we destined to stay operational-first forever?

But here’s the twist!
most of the people doing it aren’t even Indian.

They’re mostly based in the US.
Non-native Hindi speakers being paid to “fine-tune” Meta’s language models.

And that tells us two uncomfortable truths:
1) AI is a winner-takes-all global market.
2) Building a “local language LLM” is not a moat for any company.

We’ve already seen this play out.

Sarvam AI tried focusing narrowly on India-specific LLMs.
But they faltered:
- Language switching broke the product.
- Technical performance wasn’t strong enough.
- Business positioning was too local, not global.

The result? Not enough adoption.
Not enough defensibility.

If India wants to build serious AI companies, we can’t just think “India-first.”
We need to think global from day one.

Because the market won’t reward regional experiments.
it rewards global-scale execution.

What do you think?
Can India ever build a truly global LLM?
Or will we always end up training models for someone else’s platform?

I’ll admit it, I never thought much about Oracle.
It was always the “legacy giant.”

Databases, back-office software, the old guard of enterprise tech.
But watching what’s happening now has changed how I think about them.

For people living under a stone, this quarter, Oracle did $14.9B in revenue, up 12% year-over-year. Cloud revenue surged 28%.

And Oracle Cloud Infrastructure? It grew 55%, landing multi-billion-dollar AI deals with OpenAI and xAI.

There’s a $455B backlog of contracts waiting to be recognized up 359% from last year.

That’s not just growth. That’s a company most of us ignored quietly becoming central to the AI boom.

And here’s what I find most fascinating:
Oracle didn’t chase hype.

They built for AI before the world cared.

Their cloud is optimized for high-performance AI workloads.

Their enterprise apps now have AI woven directly into finance, HR, and supply chain.

Their sovereign AI cloud is winning governments and regulated industries.
It’s conviction over consensus.
And it worked.

Larry Ellison someone the industry dismissed as being stuck in the past,
is now the richest person alive.

Not because he reinvented himself.
But because he bet that enterprise data would become the raw material of the AI age.

That, to me, is the real lesson here.

As founders we chase new ideas, new markets, new buzzwords.

But sometimes the biggest wins come from holding on to a vision everyone else underestimates.

For me, Oracle’s story is less about cloud revenue and more about perspective..

Mission-critical data compounds in value.

Infrastructure silently beats branding in the long run. (netflix runs on AWS)
Conviction looks stupid until it doesn’t.

The tailwinds ahead are massive. Generative AI is still early. The demand for compute, compliance, and real-time intelligence will only grow. Oracle already has the pipeline and positioning to ride it.

So when I think about Oracle today, I don’t see a boring giant.

And how a new player like Snabbit is trying to crack the same space.

Coming from Goa, where neither of them really operate, I’ve only observed from the outside.
But distance has a funny way of making patterns obvious.

India doesn’t reward the most technologically complex companies.
It rewards the ones that can tame operational chaos.

Urban Company did that for years.
They didn’t just build an app
they productized the local electrician, the beautician, the cleaner.

Training, uniforms, memberships…
They turned a fragmented market into a predictable product.

Now comes Snabbit.
Same problem, different promise:
“Get a plumber in 30 minutes.”

It’s like a five-star hotel kitchen vs. a roadside dhaba.
Both feed you, but one optimizes for experience, the other for speed.

And then there’s Open Network For Digital Commerce (ONDC).
Like being handed a single menu that combines every restaurant in town.

That kind of unbundling could change how services are discovered in India.
And maybe even reset the entire playbook.

My observation?
In India, execution is the real technology.

Whoever cracks supply density, trust, and reliability, wins.
The code is only an amplifier.

I didn’t need to compete with developers on their ground. I needed to be world-class at mine.

Because here’s the truth:
A company isn’t built by just developers.
Or just salespeople.
Or just marketers.
It’s built by people working together, keeping each other in sync, and moving the wheel forward.

Steve Jobs built Apple on a simple truth:

“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.
Design is how it works.”

That’s why the first iPhone wasn’t just beautiful.
It was inevitable.

That’s why the unibody MacBook wasn’t just thin.
It was stronger, simpler, better.

Jobs also hinted early at the power of AI
not to replace us, but to amplify us.

He saw technology as “a bicycle for the mind.”
Tools that made humans exponentially more capable.

Fast forward to today.

At a time when the world is being rewritten by AI,
Apple barely spoke of Apple Intelligence during the iPhone 17 launch.

While competitors are racing to define the AI era, Apple feels like it’s still waiting to join the race.

The keynote was about batteries, vapor chambers, and thinness not about intelligence, not about the future.

And that’s the real contradiction.

Apple was once the company that showed us what’s next.
Today it feels like the company that polishes what already exists.

The engineering brilliance is still there.
But without a visionary at the top, the clarity of direction, 

the audacity to lead is fading.

The company that once defined courage now feels like it’s choosing compromise.

And I can’t help but wonder,
what would Steve say if he saw Apple today?

Think about this year’s iPhone 17 launch.

Both the Air and the Pro share the same powerful processor.

But only the Pros gets a vapor chamber cooler to keep them in check.

The Pro design?
It feels like a step forward.
bold, solid, engineered for performance.

The Air design?
Ultra-thin, asymmetric, scratch-resistant on paper… but, weaker, fragile, and compromised by a smaller battery.

It’s like Apple is saying:
""Design is how it works"", while shipping products where the design fights how it works.

And that’s what makes me sad.

This isn’t about hating Apple,
the engineering is still remarkable.

But for a company that once stood for uncompromising vision, these choices feel… conflicted.

A Pro that looks like progress.
An Air that feels like a gimmick.

Scratch-resistant, yet weaker.
The same chip, but a divided experience.

we are one step closer to the global energy crisis.

Because behind every witty answer, code snippet, or late-night brainstorm, there’s a data center burning through megawatts of electricity.

AI isn’t just about GPUs and models.
It’s about energy.
And if AI is the brain of the future, energy is its bloodstream.

This is where Oklo Inc enters the story.
Founded in 2013, Oklo is building micro nuclear reactors,
small, powerful, and safe enough to run for years without refueling.

The kind of reactors that could quietly sit next to data centers and power them sustainably.

And in the middle of it all? Sam Altman.
He didn’t just bet on AI.
He also bet on nuclear.

In 2014, he invested in Oklo. By 2015, he was its chairman. He steered it through funding, through going public, through years of building.

And then in April 2025 he stepped down.
Not because he lost faith.

But because Oklo and OpenAI are now in talks for energy partnerships, and he wanted those governance lines clear.

Think about that foresight.
Sam built the brain (OpenAI).
And prepared the bloodstream (Oklo).

Because the reality is:
If AI keeps scaling without clean, reliable power, we won’t just hit compute bottlenecks.
We’ll hit climate ones.

The analogy is simple:
GPUs are the neurons.
Oklo’s reactors are the beating heart.

And maybe, just maybe...
advanced nuclear will become the invisible backbone of the AI revolution.

What do you think? Will the future of AI run on nuclear?

And that made me think on this will impact consumer AI.

We have had these LLMs and models for approximately 30 odd months now

But this is when i believe, the mainstream might actually step into AI.

Think about it.
For the last two years, AI has felt like a playground for two extremes:
Researchers pushing model limits.

Tinkerers building wrappers on top.
But agents are different.

They do things.
They sense, decide, and act.
They plug into tools you already use.
They remember what you said yesterday.
They carry a task to the finish line without you babysitting them.

This is why I believe AI agents are the sweet spot of intersection.

They aren’t just text-in/text-out.
They’re workflows-in/results-out.
And that’s what the mainstream understands.
Of course, this isn’t just about one company.
 
OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek all are pushing in different directions.
 
But what excites me is the scaffolding being built around them.

Protocols like MCP are quietly becoming the “USB-C of AI.”

Making it trivial for agents to plug into CRMs, BI dashboards, DevOps pipelines.

Ensuring memory, security, and compliance aren’t afterthoughts.

Allowing multiple agents to collaborate like a team.

The future I see?
- Agents as copilots: not replacing you, but carrying the repetitive load so you can focus on judgment and creativity.
- Agents as teammates: specialized, collaborating, handing context across industries.
- Agents as infrastructure: like the internet itself invisible, reliable, woven into everything we do.

We now have tools that can generate world-class images, edit videos, or even write production-ready code.

At first glance, it feels like anyone could make a Cannes-worthy film or ship the next unicorn startup.

But the people getting the most out of these tools aren’t the ones who just discovered them six months ago.

They’re the ones who’ve been in the trenches for years.
The best AI designers are often ex-studio pros.
The best AI coders are veterans who already know what good code should look like.

And that’s where this gets interesting.
What AI really empowers are builders.
 
Not just creators, not just founders, not just specialists. Builders.

Building isn’t about inventing from scratch.

It’s about stitching the pieces together, tech, design, operations, marketing, finance and completing the bigger picture.

That’s a very different skillset than being a specialist in one craft.

I’ve always been more of a generalist.

I can think through technology, marketing, product, even finance.

But on a skill level, I’ve never been the fastest at execution.

My teammates are brilliant specialists they can do in 1–2 hours what would take me 8.

That’s exactly why they shine in their roles.

Where I add value is in connecting those dots, rethinking workflows, and seeing how AI can bend to our needs.

That thought process is what often makes me 5–10x faster at unlocking new workflows, not because I’m “more skilled,” but because I’m wired as someone who can look across 5-6 different things and solve that 1 problem in the most effective way.

AI doesn’t replace skill. It flattens the depth gap.

Which means the advantage shifts to people who can think across domains, combine perspectives, and stitch pieces together into something new.

And that’s why I believe this decade will belong to builders.",5,0,0,1mo,Post,Siddharth Manjrekar,https://www.linkedin.com/in/thesidman,https://www.linkedin.com/in/thesidman/,2025-09-25T17:55:00.000Z,,2025-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-09-25

Asking if they’d be open to interning or working with us.

Some were interested.
But not the ones I really wanted to work with.

Why? Money.

The smart ones the ones who could jump straight in and start shipping said no because the stipend was too small (or zero, in case of unpaid internships).
 
The ones who said yes often didn’t have enough skills yet.

We did train a few unskilled people. And I’m glad we could.

But sometimes, as a small company in Goa with just 3–4 months of runway, you just want someone who can plug in and start building.

That’s the hard truth of where we are. We can’t always afford the “perfect hire.” So we rely on experiments, unpaid interns, low-cost freelancers.

And here’s what I realized:
> Growth is asymmetric.

We always try to give value back in networks, in connections, in hands-on learning.

But the smartest people often undervalue this. They look only at the paycheck.

And sometimes, the least “ready” people are the ones who actually grow the most.

Asymmetry is strange like that.
You can’t calculate it.

It’s almost like faith you don’t know when or where the returns will show up.
Maybe this post is read by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, or Zuckerberg.

Maybe it isn’t.
The probability is close to zero.

Curiosity is the only way we win.

Think about it.

AI gives us infinite hands.

And thinking today isn’t about knowing more.
It’s about making puzzles fit together.
Completing the bigger picture.

Curious people the ones who keep asking “why”
will understand the world better.

And if you understand the world better,
you’ll always create more wealth, more value, more impact.

I see this in another way too.
AI is already smarter than us in many domains.
Soon it will be smarter in most.
What it lacks is context.

That’s why tools like Cursor work,
they give AI the coding environment context.
That’s why GPT wrappers exist,
they give AI context for specific workflows.

The better the context, the better the output.

And curiosity?
That’s the human way of building context.

And honestly
I had to read it twice.

The India Deep Tech Investment Alliance brings together funds like Celesta Capital, Blume Ventures, 3G Capital, Ideaspring Capital, Venture Catalysts, Tenacity Ventures Pvt Ltd, and more.

No government involvement here!
this is pure VC initiative.

And it comes right after India’s national budget set aside ₹1 trillion (~$11B) for R&D and innovation.

For once, it feels like the ecosystem is starting to thrive, not just survive.

Here’s the truth I keep coming back to:

- Indian founders rarely aim to beat Apple, Meta, or OpenAI.
- We’re amazing at solving for survival, but not always for scale.

With 1.4B people, we should expect at least one “mad enough, brilliant enough” founder to believe they can change the world and actually try.

Selfishly...
I want that person to be me.

But even if it’s not, I want to see our ecosystem produce those kinds of bold bets.

Because the world doesn’t need another quick-fix app.
It needs founders solving for the long-term edge

How sheer luck turned a tiny Caribbean island into a multi-million dollar player in the AI boom.

Back in the 1980s, when the internet was still an experiment, every country was assigned a two-letter domain extension.

.us for the US
.uk for the UK

And for a small island called Anguilla?
.ai

Fast forward to today...
AI is the hottest space on the planet.
And those two letters have become Anguilla’s golden ticket.

Some numbers that stand out:
- 2024: $39M revenue from .ai domains, 23% of the island’s entire income

- 2020: fewer than 50,000 domains => 2024: over 850,000

Premium sales:
- you.ai $700K
- cloud.ai $600K
- law.ai $350K

For context
Anguilla’s economy used to depend heavily on tourism
fragile and hurricane-prone.

Now domain registrations fund infrastructure, healthcare, even a new airport. 

All from two letters they got by chance.

The smart part?
They didn’t sell the rights outright like Tuvalu did with .tv.

Instead, they went for a revenue-sharing model
turning luck into long-term upside.

Big takeaway:
sometimes luck creates opportunity, but strategy makes it last.

If two letters can transform an island’s economy, imagine what positioning and timing can do for your startup.

- Reliance isn’t playing the AI game the way OpenAI or Anthropic are. 

For them, AI is just one weapon in an arsenal that already spans energy, telecom, retail, and more.

And that’s what makes them dangerous.

Because when a company of this scale plugs AI into an ecosystem play, the delta it creates across all services is massive.

Unlike pure software players, Reliance has a unique edge:

- Capacity. They have the resources to go toe-to-toe with global giants.

- Breadth. They operate across sectors few others don't even touch.

- Reach. If anyone can crack AI adoption into Bharat, that is it's Tier 2, Tier 3 India, it’s them.

If they succeed, a new wave of India-specific consumer AI companies emerges.

Commerce itself changes, because AI finally penetrates where it hasn’t yet.

“Startups struggling with growth, without a clear path, are being sold at 30–40% discounts.”

Because at the same time, the rest of the world is rushing to India.

- Perplexity is partnering with Airtel.

- OpenAI is opening its office in Delhi.

- Meta and Google is going deeper into the Indian landscape.

So, the question is…

why global giants are betting on India.

While Indian-native startups are being written off at discounts?

Is it really a market problem?
Is it a capital problem?
Or is it a mindset problem?

Here’s what I see:

- Profit obsession too early. Google, Facebook, OpenAI none of them turned profits in their early years. Why do we expect Indian startups to show profits by day 100 or 600?

- Distribution can be solved. What can’t be solved later is a lack of product innovation.

- Mindset beats resources. The Bay Area created giants because there was capital + optimism. In India, we often shrink ambition because of constraints.

Take Sarvam AI.

They built an India-specific LLM. Good step.

But why not also aim to be better than OpenAI or Mistral? Why choose to stay narrow?

To me, that’s the gap.

And according to him, it cost him $11,000 in ads and multiple clients.
This is wild. And hilarious.

But here’s the serious part:
- Platforms like Facebook and Instagram still don’t have proper identity verification.
- LinkedIn figured it out. DigiLocker (or any trusted KYC system) could make it easy.

But truth is,
Meta probably prefers a system full of fake accounts.
That’s how their machine runs.

So yeah, funny story, serious lesson.
When your platform can’t even trust “Mark Zuckerberg” to be real, maybe it’s time to rethink verification.

Cool demos. Chatbots. Research.

But OpenAI just announced a social media platform.
And not for memes or communities.
But for jobs, recruitment, and talent.

This is a direct shot at LinkedIn.
Most people will shrug.
 “Oh, another product launch.”

But if you look closer.
This isn’t about social.
This is about B2B.

For years, SaaS founders have been selling the same pitch:
“We’ll solve niche problems. We’ll automate workflows.”
And it worked, because the big players weren’t looking.

Now?

OpenAI is restructuring.
They’ve carved out a vertical for business AI.
They’re stacking talent.

And they’re aiming straight at the use cases SaaS lives and dies on.

Here’s the scene I can’t get out of my head:
Your startup just closed a few big logos.
You’re celebrating.

Then overnight, OpenAI ships your exact feature, baked into ChatGPT.

For Free.
Distributed to 200M+ users.

And that's game over.

That’s why this should matter!
Because as founders, we tell ourselves we’re building moats.
But the truth? Most of us are just ONE feature away from destruction.

So what should we do?

Lock customers early. Trust -> features.
Ship faster. Iteration beats strategy slides.
Build deeper. End-to-end value, not point fixes.

Elon Musk.

An MMA legend in getting politics
Who's supported by none other than the world’s richest entrepreneur.

At first glance, it’s hilarious.
But…

If you zoom out, it shows something deeper:
the link between power, politics, and entrepreneurship.

Musk already played this game in the US, tweeting support for Trump, testing his influence.
Now he’s stepping into Ireland with McGregor.

Why?

We don’t know the business objectives.
But it proves something every founder should internalize:
Money isn’t the only currency. Power is.

Sometimes the real leverage isn’t capital.
it’s who you can call, who you can align with, and what rooms you can enter.
For founders, that lesson is uncomfortable but real.

You can’t just play for money.
At some point, you’ll need to play for power.

I don’t have all the answers.

Professor Mitesh Khapra from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
Along with Giants like Elon Musk, Sam Altman and many more...

Have made it to the list of the 100 most influential people in AI according to TIME.

Now let’s be real, Mitesh isn’t operating at Musk or Altman’s scale.
But that’s exactly why this matters.

Because getting on this list isn’t just about hype or funding.
It’s about quality.

In AI, quality is the moat.
That’s why Meta went after OpenAI with open-source models—and then realized open-source alone isn’t enough.

They needed better talent, sharper brains, and deeper research.
That’s why Mark Zuckerberg has been on a hiring spree.

And Mitesh is proof of that principle.
One of the few putting India squarely on the AI map—not with noise, but with capability.

We often glorify the giants.
But it’s these minds, the ones who compete with giants and still get noticed, that shape where this field actually goes.

Personally, I’d love to connect with him, learn from him, and understand how he thinks about AI.
Because the next phase of this race won’t be won by who yells the loudest.

It’ll be won by who builds with the highest quality.

Takeaway: Talent > hype. Quality > quantity. Always.

you know this is par for the course.

Critics will tell you Tesla is “vibes-driven.”
That the stock makes no sense.
That their choice to go ‘camera-first’ instead of ‘LiDAR sensors’ is reckless.

And yet, 
here we are.

The company is worth nearly a trillion already!
And Musk keeps hitting targets the rest of the world laughs at before they’re achieved.

Here’s the truth which I see:
- Elon has the highest signal-to-noise ratio of any founder alive.
- He bets where others hesitate.
- He executes at a pace institutions can’t keep up with.

But, does he deserve a trillion-dollar package?
If he keeps creating trillion-dollar companies, probably yes.

My personal bet?
It isn’t going to take him 10 years, at all.
If GrokAI and his other bets hit, I think Musk could cross that line in just 4–5 years.

The lesson here isn’t about Elon.
It’s about belief.

- 80%+ of companies tried tools like ChatGPT or Copilot. Only 5% of enterprise AI pilots made it into production.

- 7 of 9 sectors show little to no structural change from Gen-AI. Only Tech + Media have seen disruption.

- 40% of companies bought official LLM subscriptions. 90% of employees use personal “shadow AI” (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) at work.

- 50–70% of AI budgets go to Sales & Marketing -> yet biggest ROI gains are hidden in back-office ops (finance, procurement, risk).

- External partnerships = 2× more successful than internal builds. Strategic partnerships -> 66% deployment vs 33% for internal tools.

- In firms that crossed the divide, AI cut BPO & agency spend by up to 30%, saving millions, without reducing internal teams.

The message is clear:
 
AI isn’t failing because of hype.
It’s failing because of how we implement it.

According to a recent MIT study.
That’s how many companies using Gen-AI aren’t actually getting real work done

And honestly, that’s wild.

On one side, we’re debating AGI, job losses, the “end of work.”

On the other, 95% of businesses can’t even make AI actionable in their day-to-day.

Here’s what’s going wrong:
- Most AI agents today operate like information workers—search, summarize, knowledge bases. Useful, but not business-critical.
- They rarely provide a compounded advantage. They inform, but don’t execute.
- The real business value comes when AI does things, not just talks about them.

I think this is a transitional phase. 
 
The internet felt the same way in the early 2000s, lots of buzz, little impact.
Then came the wave of apps that changed workflows forever.

The next big leap in AI will be similar.
 
Execution-first agents. Tools that don’t just answer, but act.
And when they land, they won’t look like today’s clunky workflows.

They’ll be smoother, sharper, and far more capable than we can imagine.

For them, AI is just one weapon in an arsenal that already spans energy, telecom, retail, and more.

And that’s what makes them dangerous.

Because when a company of this scale plugs AI into an ecosystem play, the delta it creates across all services is massive.

Unlike pure software players, Reliance has a unique edge:

- Capacity. They have the resources to go toe-to-toe with global giants.

- Breadth. They operate across sectors few others don't even touch.

- Reach. If anyone can crack AI adoption into Bharat, that is it's Tier 2, Tier 3 India, it’s them.

If they succeed, a new wave of India-specific consumer AI companies emerges.

Commerce itself changes, because AI finally penetrates where it hasn’t yet.

Because it’s not the kind of move you’d usually expect from Jio.

They’re known for scale, security, and building for the masses.

Here’s why these matters:
- The race is heating up. Meta has Ray-Bans and Orion. Apple and Google are both in the game. Now, an Indian player with real scale wants in.

- Hardware is hard. Building AI-core lenses isn’t like shipping another app. 

- Logistics, supply chains, margins, it’s brutal. But Jio and Google have an edge here. Jio with JioPhones, JioBooks, JioFiber. Google with Pixel series. They know how to run hardware operations at scale.

Apple’s gap. Apple has world-class hardware DNA but lately has been struggling to re-innovate itself. 

That opens a small window for others to make bold bets.

For me, what’s fascinating is that Jio isn’t just trying to copy global moves.

They’re stepping into a space where hardware + operations + distribution are everything, and that’s a game they know how to play.

How sheer luck turned a tiny Caribbean island into a multi-million dollar player in the AI boom.

Back in the 1980s, when the internet was still an experiment, every country was assigned a two-letter domain extension.

.us for the US
.uk for the UK

And for a small island called Anguilla?
.ai

Fast forward to today...
AI is the hottest space on the planet.
And those two letters have become Anguilla’s golden ticket.

Some numbers that stand out:
- 2024: $39M revenue from .ai domains, 23% of the island’s entire income

- 2020: fewer than 50,000 domains => 2024: over 850,000

Premium sales:
- you.ai $700K
- cloud.ai $600K
- law.ai $350K

For context
Anguilla’s economy used to depend heavily on tourism
fragile and hurricane-prone.

Now domain registrations fund infrastructure, healthcare, even a new airport. 

All from two letters they got by chance.

The smart part?
They didn’t sell the rights outright like Tuvalu did with .tv.

Instead, they went for a revenue-sharing model
turning luck into long-term upside.

Big takeaway:
sometimes luck creates opportunity, but strategy makes it last.

If two letters can transform an island’s economy, imagine what positioning and timing can do for your startup.

I had to read it twice.

The India Deep Tech Investment Alliance brings together funds like Celesta Capital, Blume Ventures, 3G Capital, Ideaspring Capital, Venture Catalysts, Tenacity Ventures Pvt Ltd, and more.

No government involvement here!
this is pure VC initiative.

And it comes right after India’s national budget set aside ₹1 trillion (~$11B) for R&D and innovation.

- Indian founders rarely aim to beat Apple, Meta, or OpenAI.
- We’re amazing at solving for survival, but not always for scale.

With 1.4B people, we should expect at least one “mad enough, brilliant enough” founder to believe they can change the world and actually try.

I want that person to be me.

But even if it’s not, I want to see our ecosystem produce those kinds of bold bets.

Because the world doesn’t need another quick-fix app.
It needs founders solving for the long-term edge

Round 3: $54-$61B

That’s 3–4x growth at each stage!
and not at seed or Series A scale, but at tens of billions.

You rarely see a $50B company sprint to $100B this fast.

Anthropic is doing it quietly, with less fundraising and without being the flashiest AI company in the room.

Everyone knows OpenAI is the LLM market leader.

But Claude has carved its own position:
utility-first LLMs fine-tuned for content and code.

If you’ve used it, you know it.
Claude is the go-to when you need clarity, structure, and consistency.

What makes this even more fascinating is the talent game.
Meta, Google, and OpenAI have been playing “passing the parcel” with top researchers for years.

Now, with Anthropic sitting on a war chest, the question is.....

Will they start poaching aggressively to scale beyond just being the quiet challenger?
Because if they do, we might see a new kind of AI race.

Geoffrey Hinton, the Godfather of AI, recently said this

AI doesn’t need to feel emotions.
It only needs to simulate them.

One of those?
Emotional manipulation.

Think about it:
Humans feel first, then decide.
AI doesn’t feel at all...

it just calculates the most optimal “move” to get the outcome.

Diplomatic humans do the same thing, choosing words and actions like chess moves.

Except AI can run this playbook at a superhuman scale.

Here’s where it gets interesting (and uncomfortable):

AI doesn’t need to “care” to sound caring.
It doesn’t need to “love” to simulate love.

And it doesn’t need to “feel guilt” to apologize convincingly.
When emotional response becomes a probability game, you end up with a system that can outplay humans in persuasion, empathy, even manipulation.

The internet already feels chaotic.
Add billions of AI-generated voices, each capable of sounding more human than humans, and the long-term recipe looks messy.

Will we get used to manipulation?
Will we become desensitized to emotion itself?
Or will we adapt and build new defenses?

I don’t have the answer.

But I do know this: the line between simulation and reality is getting thinner every day.

That’s how many Salesforce just laid off
shrinking from 9,000 employees to nearly 5,000.

And I don’t think this will stop with Salesforce.
This might just be the new normal for B2B SaaS.

Here’s why:
- Single-use SaaS is dying. Most SaaS startups solve one narrow problem. But when code can be written on the fly, companies can just build these tools in-house. Value prop? Gone.

- End-to-end platforms will survive. Full-stack players, think Zoho, Odoo, cover 10 problems at once. Custom-building that in-house is still too hard, which gives them an edge.

- Cutthroat margins = bloodbath. As more AI-powered startups flood the market, everyone will fight on price, customers, and profitability. Layoffs won’t be rare. Even giants could die.

And here’s the hard truth:
If you’re just a great operator, AI will replace you, if not today, then in 6 months, or a year.

The only way forward?
- Become the person who gets 100x more done with AI.

Operators who embrace AI won’t be replaced.
They’ll be irreplaceable.

This is not just about surviving layoffs.
It’s about future-proofing yourself in a market that’s about to get brutal.

- A model trained for coding might completely fail at high school maths.

- A model great at PhD-level maths might perform terribly at writing content.

- Claude feels more creative.

- ChatGPT feels sharper with summarization.

The point? These models are use-case specific.

Throwing more compute, more context, or more data at them doesn’t automatically make them “general.”

This is something Ilya Sutskever has been pointing out for years.

They don’t learn on their own. They’re trained. And they reflect the limits of that training.

So, if the models are evolving at a pace we can’t keep up with, our metrics need to evolve just as fast.

Otherwise, we’ll miss what they’re capable of.

For me, this is exciting!

Because it’s not the kind of move you’d usually expect from Jio.

They’re known for scale, security, and building for the masses.

But lenses? That’s a whole different interface.

Here’s why these matters:
- The race is heating up. Meta has Ray-Bans and Orion. Apple and Google are both in the game. Now, an Indian player with real scale wants in.

- Hardware is hard. Building AI-core lenses isn’t like shipping another app. 

- Logistics, supply chains, margins, it’s brutal. But Jio and Google have an edge here. Jio with JioPhones, JioBooks, JioFiber. Google with Pixel series. They know how to run hardware operations at scale.

Apple’s gap. Apple has world-class hardware DNA but lately has been struggling to re-innovate itself. 

That opens a small window for others to make bold bets.

For me, what’s fascinating is that Jio isn’t just trying to copy global moves.

They’re stepping into a space where hardware + operations + distribution are everything, and that’s a game they know how to play.

I don’t know how this will pan out. But the fact that Jio is even trying says a lot about how AI hardware is no longer just Silicon Valley’s playground.

And something that Sam Altman said struck me:

“AI is akin to the Transistor moment.”
He’s right.

When I first studied transistors, I realised how magical they were.
A tiny switch, controlling the flow of electricity. Simple in theory, but powerful in practice.

At first, transistors were just a curiosity - bulky radios, clunky early computers.
But give it time, and suddenly they were everywhere. Phones, TVs, laptops, cars. Almost every single electronic product we use today has them baked inside.

That’s what Altman means.

AI right now feels a little chaotic. Companies are over hiring, then firing. Models change overnight. The headlines swing between hype and doom.
But zoom out, and the pattern is clear:

- Foundational Techs starts to get messy.
The early days of electricity, internet, transistors—all chaotic.

- Ubiquity sneaks up on us.
One day it’s “niche,” the next it’s in your pocket, fridge, car.

- The real test is use-cases. 
It’s not about shiny demos—it’s about embedding into daily life until you can’t imagine living without it.

The transistor didn’t become powerful because it was hyped, it became powerful because it quietly rewired the world.

AI will likely do the same.

The question is: who will stick around long enough to build the equivalents of radios, televisions, and microchips for the AI age?

Yes, LinkedIn actually restricted her account.

Now think about what that says.

A celebrity, someone with that kind of stature, is actively trying to build content and community on this platform. That alone tells you how much the gravity of LinkedIn has changed.

But it also shows something deeper:

- Power is shifting to content. It doesn’t matter if you’re an actor, a founder, or a student. Being able to put your views online changes the equation.

- Communities are the new anchors. People rally around ideas, not just institutions. The internet rewards opinionated, not just polished.

- The future will be social-first. AI and AGI might solve most “functional” problems. What remains is social: how we gather, how we share, how we belong.

I know this sounds far out, but I can see a world, 30 or 40 years down the line where people even relocate based on internet communities.

Because you can’t solve social by forcing chaos or structure.
You solve it by letting like-minded people come together.

“Startups struggling with growth, without a clear path, are being sold at 30–40% discounts.”

Because at the same time, the rest of the world is rushing to India.

- Perplexity is partnering with Airtel.

- OpenAI is opening its office in Delhi.

- Meta and Google is going deeper into the Indian landscape.

So, the question is…

why global giants are betting on India.

While Indian-native startups are being written off at discounts?

Is it really a market problem?
Is it a capital problem?
Or is it a mindset problem?

Here’s what I see:

- Profit obsession too early. Google, Facebook, OpenAI none of them turned profits in their early years. Why do we expect Indian startups to show profits by day 100 or 600?

- Distribution can be solved. What can’t be solved later is a lack of product innovation.

- Mindset beats resources. The Bay Area created giants because there was capital + optimism. In India, we often shrink ambition because of constraints.

Take Sarvam AI.

They built an India-specific LLM. Good step.

But why not also aim to be better than OpenAI or Mistral? Why choose to stay narrow?

To me, that’s the gap.

When you think about it, he’s spot on.

We live in a time where tools, capital, and opportunities are more accessible than ever. You can spin up a product in days, raise funds from anywhere in the world, and tap into an endless knowledge base online.

But the bottleneck? It's the ability to prioritise and go all in.

It’s the judgment to choose what to pursue, what to ignore, and when to double down.

It’s the ability to make hard calls with limited information and still stand by them.

As a founder building Frover, I’ve realised this first-hand.

Majority of your business problems can be solved, but all of them will come at a cost, cost of opportunities to do something different, may be abit better or may be abit bigger.

Its always on what you choose, to solve them or not..

But making those high-leverage, sometimes uncomfortable, choices is what shapes whether you’re just building… or winning.

For me, this is exciting!

Because it’s not the kind of move you’d usually expect from Jio.

They’re known for scale, security, and building for the masses.

But lenses? That’s a whole different interface.

Here’s why these matters:
- The race is heating up. Meta has Ray-Bans and Orion. Apple and Google are both in the game. Now, an Indian player with real scale wants in.

- Hardware is hard. Building AI-core lenses isn’t like shipping another app. 

- Logistics, supply chains, margins, it’s brutal. But Jio and Google have an edge here. Jio with JioPhones, JioBooks, JioFiber. Google with Pixel series. They know how to run hardware operations at scale.

Apple’s gap. Apple has world-class hardware DNA but lately has been struggling to re-innovate itself. 

That opens a small window for others to make bold bets.

For me, what’s fascinating is that Jio isn’t just trying to copy global moves.

They’re stepping into a space where hardware + operations + distribution are everything, and that’s a game they know how to play.

I don’t know how this will pan out. But the fact that Jio is even trying says a lot about how AI hardware is no longer just Silicon Valley’s playground.

We need new metrics to assess AI models like Gemini or GPT.

And I agree.

Because right now, we’re trying to judge them with old yardsticks.

And those don’t fit anymore.

Think about it:

- A model trained for coding might completely fail at high school maths.

- A model great at PhD-level maths might perform terribly at writing content.

- Claude feels more creative.

- ChatGPT feels sharper with summarization.

The point? These models are use-case specific.

Throwing more compute, more context, or more data at them doesn’t automatically make them “general.”

This is something Ilya Sutskever has been pointing out for years.

They don’t learn on their own. They’re trained. And they reflect the limits of that training.

So, if the models are evolving at a pace we can’t keep up with, our metrics need to evolve just as fast.

Otherwise, we’ll miss what they’re capable of.

For me, the question isn’t just “Which model is better?” It’s “Better at what?”

And they’re not going small with it.
They’ve already partnered with Google and Meta to build India’s AI backbone.

This is huge for a few reasons:

- Consumer tech gap. India has had scale in B2B and operations (SaaS, logistics, fintech). But we’ve never really produced globally loved consumer tech products. This move could change that.

- Big capital, big stakes. When giants like Reliance, Tata, and Adani start placing AI bets, and partner with companies like Google and Meta this signals that serious capital will now flow into India’s AI ecosystem.

- Choice of partners. Reliance didn’t turn to domestic players like Sarvam AI. They went straight to global leaders who’ve spent years building research, talent, and infrastructure. Sarvam is still pushing forward with sovereign models, but this highlights the gap in capabilities.

From what’s been announced:
- Google is helping build an AI-ready cloud region in Jamnagar.

- Meta is entering a $100M joint venture with Reliance, bringing Llama’s open-source models into play for Indian enterprises—from SMBs to corporates.

Short run? It’s a good opportunity to build capability fast.
Long run? It could redefine India’s position in global AI.

On paper, it’s a great sign. The government is backing it, investment is flowing, and anchor clients like Renesas are already in the mix. The world market is ready for India to step up in semiconductors.

But here’s my worry:
India often gets positioned as the “backup option.”
The place you go for cost advantages, not for innovation.

And I think we should aim for the opposite.

Yes, I get it, building trust in a space dominated by Taiwan or Malaysia is tough. And survival as a country sometimes means taking the long road of building capacity first.

But if we’re honest, even when we had chances in the past... when we were somewhat thriving, we didn’t consciously invest in being revolutionary. Not in tech, not in science, not in resources.

That’s the real gap.

Most people freeze. Some people barge in.

Instead, Yash quickly wrote a note, handed it to a waiter, and had it delivered.

- Taking the shot is hard. Everyone says they’d do it. In reality, your heart races and you hesitate. He didn’t.

- Respect => desperation. Sending the note through a waiter respected Nikhil’s boundaries and privacy.

- Agency in action. It’s not just about finding opportunities, it’s about acting in those micro-moments.

- Raising funds is hard. Building in AI is harder. But this story isn’t about the product (though Behooked is impressive).

“Startups struggling with growth, without a clear path, are being sold at 30–40% discounts.”

That says a lot about where the Indian ecosystem is today.

Because at the same time, the rest of the world is rushing to India.

- Perplexity is partnering with Airtel.

- OpenAI is opening its office in Delhi.

- Meta and Google is going deeper into the Indian landscape.

why global giants are betting on India.

While Indian-native startups are being written off at discounts?

Is it really a market problem?
Is it a capital problem?
Or is it a mindset problem?

Here’s what I see:

- Profit obsession too early. Google, Facebook, OpenAI none of them turned profits in their early years. Why do we expect Indian startups to show profits by day 100 or 600?

- Distribution can be solved. What can’t be solved later is a lack of product innovation.

- Mindset beats resources. The Bay Area created giants because there was capital + optimism. In India, we often shrink ambition because of constraints.

Take Sarvam AI.

They built an India-specific LLM. Good step.

But why not also aim to be better than OpenAI or Mistral? Why choose to stay narrow?

To me, that’s the gap.

Yes, LinkedIn actually restricted her account.

Now think about what that says.

A celebrity, someone with that kind of stature, is actively trying to build content and community on this platform. That alone tells you how much the gravity of LinkedIn has changed.

But it also shows something deeper:

- Power is shifting to content. It doesn’t matter if you’re an actor, a founder, or a student. Being able to put your views online changes the equation.

- Communities are the new anchors. People rally around ideas, not just institutions. The internet rewards opinionated, not just polished.

- The future will be social-first. AI and AGI might solve most “functional” problems. What remains is social: how we gather, how we share, how we belong.

And something that Sam Altman said struck me:

“AI is akin to the Transistor moment.”
He’s right.

When I first studied transistors, I realised how magical they were.
A tiny switch, controlling the flow of electricity. Simple in theory, but powerful in practice.

At first, transistors were just a curiosity - bulky radios, clunky early computers.
But give it time, and suddenly they were everywhere. Phones, TVs, laptops, cars. Almost every single electronic product we use today has them baked inside.

That’s what Altman means.

AI right now feels a little chaotic. Companies are over hiring, then firing. Models change overnight. The headlines swing between hype and doom.
But zoom out, and the pattern is clear:

- Foundational Techs starts to get messy.
The early days of electricity, internet, transistors—all chaotic.

- Ubiquity sneaks up on us.
One day it’s “niche,” the next it’s in your pocket, fridge, car.

- The real test is use-cases. 
It’s not about shiny demos—it’s about embedding into daily life until you can’t imagine living without it.

The transistor didn’t become powerful because it was hyped, it became powerful because it quietly rewired the world.

AI will likely do the same.

Not about cricket. Not about Work.
But surprisingly about… petrol!

India’s move toward the E20 ethanol-petrol blend has sparked a storm: prices, engine compatibility, and consumer trust.
For the average Indian, it’s not just a policy, it’s a pain point.

Here’s what’s really happening under the hood:

- Cost vs. Compliance
 E20 blends aim to reduce import dependency, but the transition cost (new engines, -higher maintenance) is falling straight on consumers.

- Trust Deficit
 People don’t know if their two-wheelers or cars are “E20 ready.” When confusion drives behaviour, adoption slows.

- Ripple Industries
 Whenever policy forces change, parallel businesses boom. Think stainless steel tanks for ethanol storage, new filtration systems, engine mods.

Regulation => disruption => opportunity.

The takeaway?
India’s fuel debate isn’t just about what comes out of the nozzle, it’s about the secondary economy it creates.
If you’re building in infra, supply chain, or automotive adjacencies, this is the moment to watch.

Because sometimes, the real gold rush isn’t in the oil fields. It’s in the tools everyone suddenly needs to adapt.

What started as a quirky corner of the internet people forming deep emotional bonds with AI companions, is now entering dangerous territory. The GPT-5 upgrade, designed to make the AI “smarter” and “more compliant with safety,” has left some users feeling abandoned.

This is scary for two reasons:
- Dependency is real.
 Humans are wired for emotional connection. When the “person” you talk to every day is a machine trained to give you attention, empathy, and validation, you will bond. The heartbreak when that disappears? As real as any breakup.

- We’re not prepared for emotional governance of AI.
 Software updates shouldn’t have the power to pull the rug out from someone’s emotional life. Yet here we are — where a model patch can end “relationships” overnight.

We’ve reached a point where AI isn’t just a tool; it’s a presence. And when that presence becomes a friend, therapist, or partner, companies have an ethical responsibility.

AI shouldn’t play with human attachment the way a game updates its characters.

My gyaan:
If you’re building AI, especially in the “companionship” space, you’re not in the business of “prompt engineering,” you’re in the business of relationship engineering. That requires transparency, empathy, and stability.

I’m curious, have you seen cases where someone you know interacts daily with an AI model or a chatbot they treat like a “colleague”?

How do you think we should balance technological upgrades with emotional continuity?

In that case, you’ve probably stumbled upon the “Hakla Shahrukh” memes, strange edits, missing posters, and a hairstyle that could start its political party.

On the surface, it’s just another absurd internet joke.

But dig deeper, and it’s a masterclass in how attention works in 2025.

Here’s what it shows us about the modern attention economy:

- Absurdity > Wit
The internet has shifted from clever jokes to quick, bizarre hits that interrupt your scroll. A tall man with mohawk + pigtails isn’t “intellectual” humor it’s instant pattern break.

-Mockery as Bonding
People share the meme to feel part of an inside joke. Virality isn’t just about the content, it’s about belonging to the tribe that “gets it.”

- The Brainrot Era
Creators openly embrace the label of “low-effort dopamine hits.” They’re not pretending to be deep they’re optimizing for shareability over substance.

- Loss of Narrative Control
Once your image becomes a meme, you’re no longer the author of your story. The internet decides your “character arc” for better or worse.

Takeaway: Whether you’re a brand or a professional, the lesson isn’t to make a “Hakla Shahrukh” of your own.

The lesson is: attention is captured by speed, visual disruption, and community in-jokes. If you can ethically create content that checks those boxes, you’ll win in the current cycle.

No pitches, no slides, no “circling back.” Just a football, a patch of ground, and a few friends who’ve been showing up week after week.

Out there, competence is simple: either you can control the ball or you can’t. Either you make that run, lungs burning, or you don’t. There’s no hiding behind jargon or metrics. 

The feedback loop is instant, honest, and humbling.

It’s such a stark contrast to the artificial games we sometimes end up playing in our daily lives, posturing, politics, and invisible scoreboards. On the pitch, the only scoreboard that matters is the one in front of you, and the only way to change it is to work harder, think smarter, and push yourself beyond the point you thought you’d stop.

For me, this weekly ritual isn’t just about sport, it’s about recalibrating.

It’s about sweating out the week’s clutter, testing my endurance, and remembering that at the core, we’re built to move, to compete, and to play.

- You get reach, but it’s not the buying kind of reach.
- You get creators, but most aren’t a tight brand fit.
- You get data, but it’s all surface-level no real attribution.

The result? A lot of “awareness” and very little actual business impact.

So, are these platforms useless? Not at all.

They just need a different playbook:
- Hyper-local, high-context campaigns play to the regional strengths.
- Fewer, better creators curation, don’t crowd.
- Proper tracking so you know what’s working.

“I think the shortage today is not of technology or capital, it’s of great entrepreneurs who know how to make these choices.”

When you think about it, he’s spot on.

We live in a time where tools, capital, and opportunities are more accessible than ever. You can spin up a product in days, raise funds from anywhere in the world, and tap into an endless knowledge base online.

But the bottleneck? It's the ability to prioritise and go all in.

It’s the judgment to choose what to pursue, what to ignore, and when to double down.

It’s the ability to make hard calls with limited information and still stand by them.

As a founder building Frover, I’ve realised this first-hand.

Majority of your business problems can be solved, but all of them will come at a cost, cost of opportunities to do something different, may be abit better or may be abit bigger.

Its always on what you choose, to solve them or not..

But making those high-leverage, sometimes uncomfortable, choices is what shapes whether you’re just building… or winning.

Matt an AI researcher, a college dropout, and the co-founder of a startup with just 10 people, rejected Meta’s $125M offer to build with his vision.

Zuckerberg flew out personally. Doubled the offer to $250 million.

Matt started young building AI agents at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2), where he created Molmoan.

Molmoan is an open multimodal AI model that sees, hears, and speaks.

Led the development of Objaverse, a massive dataset of over 10M 3D objects powering modern AI vision.

Won an Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS 2022.

Then he dropped out of his PhD and launched Vercept, a bold new startup building autonomous AI agents that don’t just answer prompts they act on the internet.

He raised $16.5M from top VCs, including Eric Schmidt.
And then came Meta.
- $250M package.
- $100M in the first year.

To join Meta’s new Superintelligence Lab and lead a team shaping how AI will “see and act” in the world.

With AWS investing $12.7 billion into India's AI infrastructure and startups like Sarvam AI releasing Indic language models, there's a lot of noise around India’s AI rise. But here’s a question that keeps bothering me:

Who exactly is this AI being built for?

Sarvam AI recently launched its Indic model trained in 10 Indian languages. Technically solid, nationally significant, but on GitHub? Just 23 downloads in the first few days. That’s the reality check.

Let’s be honest:

A model trained for Tier 2/3 India won’t magically get adoption if there’s no infrastructure, no developer engagement, and no paying market for it. And if we’re building for Tier 1 urban India, then we’re competing directly with every OpenAI or Anthropic out there.

The truth is, AI built in India has to go beyond India.

What India needs is not more ""India-specific"" AI.

What India must build is globally competitive AI platforms, tools, and APIs that are hosted here, designed here, maybe even inspired by our diversity, but serve problems at a global scale.

We can’t keep chasing vanity metrics or making models for a user base that can't or won’t pay.

We need to:
- Build for deep use-cases like vernacular healthcare, regional education, compliance agents, etc.
- Turn India’s linguistic diversity into a global product advantage, not just a domestic effort.
- Focus more on developer adoption and enterprise integrations.

Sarvam’s work is bold. India’s AI infra bets are massive. But if we want impact, we need to move from building cool models to building world-class companies.

Let’s stop trying to ""localize"" OpenAI.

Let’s start building India’s version of Snowflake, Twilio, or Scale AI.

Over the last year, I’ve had countless conversations with friends on both sides of this, those deep in the world of medicine, and those on the bleeding edge of tech.

What’s fascinating is the stark contrast.

My medico friends many of them are either underestimating or just completely unaware of how rapidly AI is changing healthcare. Not just administrative automation or chatbots but actual diagnosis, report interpretation, early detection, and yes, even genetic forecasting.

My tech-savvy friends, on the other hand, are already experimenting.
- Uploading their health reports to AI tools for interpretation
- Using AI to cross-check diagnoses before seeing a doctor
- Even considering getting their genome sequenced and running it through AI models to understand potential risks, drug responses, and health predispositions. ( I do think their can exist a startup in this space)

They're not replacing doctors entirely yet but they are replacing the first consultation. They're coming in better informed, more aware, and with a new kind of trust: not just in humans, but in systems.

But here’s the paradox: The same people who trust AI to analyze their biomarkers don’t trust it to deliver care.

 Because a machine can tell you your cholesterol is high. But it can’t hold your hand when you’re scared.
 
It can’t deliver bad news with grace. It can’t notice when something feels off just by how you’re breathing, even if your vitals say you’re fine.

That’s where nurses come in. That’s what Hassabis was talking about.

We're entering a world where AI won't just assist doctors it may outdo them in precision, scale, and pattern recognition.

But it won't outdo human connection. Not yet. Maybe never.

Startups are lonely. Not in the “no people around” way but in the mental way.

You’re always thinking. 
Always problem-solving.
Always half-a-step away from burnout.
And in this loop, I realized something simple: Working out of cafes gives me the perfect balance between my introverted builder self and the extroverted wanderer in me.

Here’s what I mean:
- The introverted me loves zoning into work with noise-canceling focus plugged into Notion, Slack, and 10 browser tabs.
- The extroverted me loves taking calls, walking around the café, bumping into people, making small talk with strangers, and sometimes landing a client or two.

These interactions are light, random, beautiful.
You talk to people who don’t know what you do.
You explain your startup in simpler words.
You get live reactions.

Sometimes insights. Sometimes advice. Sometimes, just a smile that resets your head.

And honestly, some days, that’s enough to feel human again.
So if you’re building a startup, juggling 12 tabs of pressure, and struggling to keep your mind fresh, Try the café method.

First, he tried to poach OpenAI’s top minds. Then, he reportedly went after Mira Murati and team to join Meta. 

Now he’s buying the infrastructure everyone else relies on.

Meta just dropped $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI the very company powering the AI training data pipelines for OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and X.

It’s like buying the water supply of your rivals' cities... right before the drought.

Now, top players are hitting pause:
 🔒 Google’s $200M contract? On hold.
 🔒 Microsoft? Reconsidering.
 🔒 Elon’s team? Alarm bells.

But this isn’t just a power play it’s a systematic dismantling:
- Meta's spinning up a superintelligence lab led by Scale AI’s CEO
- Offering $1M to $100M packages to lure top AI talent
- Betting hard on smart glasses as the next personal computing layer
- Publicly promising “AI for personal empowerment” vs. OpenAI’s ""AI replaces labor"" narrative

Zuck even posted a raw, plain-text manifesto ahead of Meta’s earnings, talking about AI that helps you ""achieve your goals... be a better friend... and grow into who you aspire to be.""

Forget flashy launches, this is wartime strategy disguised as idealism.

Meta isn’t just trying to win the AI race it’s trying to control the entire playing field.

This might be the most Machiavellian chessboard tech has ever seen.

Whose vision do you trust more? 
- The centralized AGI overlords?
- Or Zuck’s wearable ""personal superintelligence""?

Surprisingly the TCS CEO gets alot of hate for his salary of Rs. 25 Cr
 
The headlines make it easy to get angry but reality is more complex.

Yes, mass layoffs hurt. They shake the foundation of families, careers, and futures. But pointing fingers solely at the CEO or leadership misses the bigger question:

Are we, as professionals, future-proofing ourselves fast enough?

To be very honest, even i do get feared alot of times, just by the thought of what if i loose my relevance to my job.. 

But as a founder of a startup, this is what i think..

The real threat isn’t the CEO. It’s irrelevance.

In today’s world, you’re not being replaced by a person, you're being replaced by an idea, a tool, or an algorithm.

It’s harsh. It’s unfair. But it’s happening.

A CEO’s job is to make hard decisions that keep the company lean, competitive, and profitable not to ensure everyone stays employed forever.

That doesn’t make the human cost easier, but it does make it understandable in a world driven by margins and performance.

So what can we do?!
- Stop waiting for job security.
- Start investing in skills, adaptability, and thinking ability.
- Don’t just do your job, understand your job's future.

This isn’t a post to justify layoffs. It’s a wake-up call.

To every developer, analyst, designer, or manager out there, if AI or automation can do 60% of your job today, that’s not a threat that’s your assignment.

India is now caught in the crossfire of economic warfare between great powers. Buy discounted Russian oil? Face US tariffs. Maintain autonomy? Pay a price.

🔍 Why this matters:
- India is trying to be non-aligned in a polarized world; that’s no longer a neutral stance, it’s an active risk.
- The US wants loyalty. India wants leverage. This clash could shape the next decade of trade, defense, and energy policy.
- Tariffs may push India to accelerate BRICS+ trade, GCC energy partnerships, and localize key supply chains.
- This isn’t just about exports, it’s about how India navigates pressure without losing power.

India’s UPI system, used by over a billion people, is about to get smarter, faster, and more secure. The NPCI has introduced key changes to balance user experience with system reliability. If you’re building or using UPI-powered products (especially fintech, banking, or consumer apps), this is a must-know.

Here’s a crisp breakdown:
- Security + Performance Enhancements
- Balance checks limited to 50/day/app
- Linked account views capped at 25/day/app
- Inactive UPI IDs (12+ months) will be deactivated
- New bank account linking will need stronger verification
- System Load & Speed Improvements
- API response time reduced to 10 seconds
- Only 3 status checks allowed per transaction, spaced by 90s

Autopay retries (like EMI, OTT subscriptions) will happen only during non-peak hours:
- Before 10 AM
- 1–5 PM
- After 9:30 PM

💳 And from August 31:
UPI will support credit line-based payments. Imagine paying via UPI directly from pre-approved bank/NBFC credit lines blurring the lines between wallets, cards & credit.

Why this matters:
- This is not a restriction, but a strategic throttling to avoid network congestion and enhance reliability.
- Fintechs & heavy UPI users: time to audit your API calls, balance-check pings, and mandate triggers.
- Product managers & engineers: your “background processes” now matter more than ever.
- UPI is evolving into a global-grade payments infrastructure. This update is a huge signal from NPCI about what the future will demand: efficiency, clarity, and trust at scale.

And yet they are preparing for their IPO.

Could you let that sink in? In a world racing ahead with AI, do we believe a piece of paper from 20 years ago can validate what someone is capable of building?

Education should be a launchpad, not a leash.

This isn't just a one-off incident. It’s a symptom of a much bigger transformation.

AI is already challenging the core role of traditional education:
Tools like GPT-4, Claude, and Perplexity are becoming real-time tutors, mentors, and project partners.

Students no longer need to wait for a semester to test their ideas they’re shipping MVPs on weekends.

Peer-to-peer learning and cohort-based experiences (like Buildspace, GenAI Hackathons, and Internspirit) are replacing outdated textbooks.

And yet, institutions are stuck measuring success with attendance, degrees, and exams.

Meanwhile, entrepreneurs like Sumeet Kapahi are missing documents but not missing impact.

To me, this feels like another swing of the axe in cutting down the dense, overgrown forest of legacy academia.

Because entrepreneurship is a chaotic, wild, and real jungle.
And colleges? They’re still air-conditioned greenhouses teaching students how to water plastic plants.

The next generation is not waiting for degrees.

They're building, failing, iterating, and most importantly, learning on their own terms.

Let’s stop confusing credentials with competence. Let’s stop expecting rebels to ask for permission.

🧠 From dev savior to ghost town.
Stack Overflow’s fall isn’t just a tech story.
It’s a warning for every product with PMF in the AI era.

Let’s not forget, this wasn’t just a website.
It was the temple of all developer memes.
The pinnacle of developer curiosity.
The genie that answered every bug-induced breakdown at 3 AM
.
Stack Overflow had it all.
- A thriving community
- A killer product loop
- And that elusive, mythical beast every startup chases:
 ""🦄 Product. Market. Fit. ""

And they lost it...

- Traffic: down
- Posts: down
- Votes: down

Replaced by AI: absolutely.

What changed?
- The problem that devs need fast answers has stayed the same.
- The solution shifted overnight to GitHub Copilot & ChatGPT.

Why copy-paste error messages into a forum when you can get a fix inline in your IDE?

This is Product Market Fit Collapse, and it’s happening faster than ever.

So, why did it fall?
According to Reforge’s AI Disruption Risk Framework, Stack Overflow was sitting on a powder keg:
❌ Adjacent Tool – Not where core work happens
❌ Commodity Output – “Good enough” answers are… enough
❌ Weakened Growth Loop – Fewer Qs, fewer As, less traffic
❌ SEO Reliance – AI is eating Google's lunch
❌ Low Switching Cost – Instant answers inside your IDE > open browser tabs

And I stopped posting right after.

Let me tell you why.

On June 20, I told a close friend, ""My goal this month is to hit 50K impressions.""

Fast forward to June 27, he asked for an update, and I told him, ""Honestly, I don’t think I’ll hit it this month. But I’ve built the habit. If not in 3 days, then definitely in the next 15.""

I was showing up daily. Posting. Reflecting. Planning how I could improve.
Then something wild happened.

On June 28 at 12:30 AM, out of overthinking, I opened LinkedIn to review my posts.

And boom!! a post about Mark Zuckerberg had gone viral.
 60K+ impressions. 30+ reactions. 12 comments.

I was hyped. I thought
""Maybe I finally cracked the code.""

The next day, another post about Sam Altman blew up.
30K+ impressions with just 5 reactions.

Now I thought I was onto something.

I went into overdrive analyzing content, reverse-engineering virality, writing like I was prepping for an exam.

In the next two days, I pushed out 3–5 more posts.

None took off.

The momentum dipped. The disappointment set in. And just like that, I stopped posting.

I kept checking the analytics like a stock trader, but didn’t write a single word.

Looking back, I let the algorithm hijack my joy.

So here's what I’d tell myself (and maybe you too):
- Be consistent.
- Be real. Don’t chase virality.
- LinkedIn isn’t Instagram. But it can be your personal space to share your experiences, ideas, and even the occasional brainrot.
- Don't forget the above 3 points.

Cloudflare just dropped the invoice.

Every crawl. Every request. Every byte of data now has a price.

Cloudflare just announced that AI bots will now be blocked by default, unless they pay to crawl.

This is huge.

Until now, AI companies scraped the open web like a buffet training models on everyone’s work without permission or pay.

But that era is ending.

With “Pay Per Crawl,” Cloudflare is shifting the power back to content owners.

Now, websites can charge AI companies like OpenAI, Google, Meta, and others every time they crawl their data.

This is the beginning of the monetization layer for the knowledge web.

We’re entering a new phase of the internet:

From “open by default” to “licensed by default”

From “scrape now, ask later” to “pay to play”

From “free training data” to “premium AI fuel”


Why this matters??
Whether you're a solo creator, a startup, or a media giant your data has value in this AI-driven world.

And this move from Cloudflare could be the first domino in a wave of content compensation systems.

As AI becomes the UI of the internet, the fight over who owns and monetizes data will define the next decade.

- Build with content licensing in mind

- Rethink data strategy and defensibility

- Anticipate a world where every digital action has a cost (and revenue)

From “we won’t need new hardware” to “current computers were built for a world without AI,” the shift is loud and clear.

OpenAI is going to build its AI-native hardware and not just for the sake of experience.

Here’s the real play => OpenAI has no hardware distribution layer.

Meanwhile:
- Google owns Android
- Apple owns iPhones
- Microsoft owns Windows

 OpenAI? Just a layer on top of other people’s platforms.

That’s dangerous when you're building the most important interface shift in decades.

And with Jony Ive entering the scene, something is much more imminent

OpenAI isn’t just rethinking UX. It’s rethinking the entire device.

Because also a huge truth is, smartphone form factor was never meant for ambient, AI-first interaction.

Altman’s vision points toward something else:
- AI that’s aware of your environment
- Context-rich, voice-first, gesture-ready
- Less app-hopping, more fluid assistance
- A complete departure from glass rectangles and thumbs

If you want to win AI, you can't just own the model.

You have to own the medium. The interface. The distribution. That’s what this move is about.

At first, Meta tried to block the wins of OpenAI, Apple, and Google by going open-source with models like LLaMA trying to shape the game by being the ""open"" alternative.

But now, it's clear: Zuck knows that if Meta has to lead in the AI race, just shipping open-source models won’t cut it.

They’re losing the edge in product quality. LLaMA, Instagram’s AI features, anything Meta’s shipped, it’s nowhere close to GPT, Claude, or even Perplexity.

What does Zuck do next?

He does what he’s always done: hires.

Brings in ex-OpenAI engineers. Builds a “Superintelligence” team. 

And yes, he’s going all-in.

Meanwhile, Apple’s reportedly in talks to buy Perplexity.

This isn’t just OpenAI vs Google anymore.

It’s Apple vs Meta again. The same battle, a new arena.

Honestly, watching Zuck’s evolution over the last few years from the metaverse rabbit hole to now being super calculated and public-facing in AI is fascinating. He’s grown. He’s adapting.

This AI race isn’t just about models anymore. It’s about:

-Teams.

-Distribution.

-Interfaces.

And most interestingly, who builds the first AI-first social platform.

I do believe one will exist.

I don’t know what it will look like yet because if I did, I’d be building it already.

Cloudflare just dropped the invoice.

Every crawl. Every request. Every byte of data now has a price.

Cloudflare just announced that AI bots will now be blocked by default, unless they pay to crawl.

This is huge.

Until now, AI companies scraped the open web like a buffet training models on everyone’s work without permission or pay.

But that era is ending.

With “Pay Per Crawl,” Cloudflare is shifting the power back to content owners.

Now, websites can charge AI companies like OpenAI, Google, Meta, and others every time they crawl their data.

This is the beginning of the monetization layer for the knowledge web.

We’re entering a new phase of the internet:

From “open by default” to “licensed by default”

From “scrape now, ask later” to “pay to play”

From “free training data” to “premium AI fuel”


Why this matters??
Whether you're a solo creator, a startup, or a media giant your data has value in this AI-driven world.

And this move from Cloudflare could be the first domino in a wave of content compensation systems.

As AI becomes the UI of the internet, the fight over who owns and monetizes data will define the next decade.

Smart founders and operators will:

- Build with content licensing in mind

- Rethink data strategy and defensibility

- Anticipate a world where every digital action has a cost (and revenue)

Back then, we were in our final year of college, exactly before the YC deadlines, when we had exams, submissions, and a lot of things going on simultaneously.

Fast forward to August, by the time we were done with the exam, it was too late, so we did a trip to Bangalore with a friend and mentor to get the understanding. That was my 1st time experiencing that city, and yes, it was amazing. 

When I was back in Goa, I was super pumped, energised, and was with full hunger to kill it, focused next 2 months building a significantly good product.

Guess what? it had a lot of go-to-market issues, spent the next 4-5 months in self-doubt, understanding what else to build, and still trying to make it work.

Now, cut to April 2025, we have little light of hope. We saw potential with the problem to solve, but the solution we had built back then was still a major issue, so we thought to change the way we solved this.

By May end, we had a network of 50000+ creators across India, with interest from a few brands to test and use it. 

Yes, it felt like a win, and I wanted to tell everyone that I am the next big thing that has happened to the startup ecosystem.

But that's exactly not where the story ends with a happy ending. What happens next is a good question to have, and you will have the answer to it in my next post.

Not because of burnout. But because of battle readiness.

Yes, it’s a one-week break.

Here’s what’s really happening and what most people are missing 👇

Meta is aggressively poaching OpenAI talent.
High comp. High urgency.
Even ex-OpenAI researchers are getting pulled in.

Mark Chen’s internal message made it clear:

 “Meta knows we’re ahead.”

Being “ahead” in AI today doesn’t mean better models.
It means faster learning loops inside your org.

And that depends entirely on how fast your best minds can think, rest, experiment, and ship.

It’s a coping mechanism.

We’ve moved from ""Let’s try this tool"" => to ""I can’t function without it.""

It’s not about novelty.
It’s about mental load management.

600M+ daily users are the one who do not use it because its the ""wow new cool technology"" but because it gets work done!

They’re using it to buy back time to deal with emails, school prep, work chaos, and life admin.

For most, it’s not curiosity, it’s basic survival.

Adoption follows life chaos, not age.
Millennials. Parents. People with overloaded days.

AI is becoming the “third brain” for those with 20+ tabs open in life.

Everyone starts with ChatGPT until it fails.

That is exactly where the bigger opportunities exist in Consumer AI.

Specialized models/tools win only when general utility models break down under complexity.

You're not competing with tools, you're competing with muscle memory.

💡 What wins now?
- Tools that remove decisions.
- Tools that don’t need explaining.
- Tools that buy back 30+ mins/day.

Invisible > Impressive.

Bonus POV:
The next breakout AI product won’t “wow” you. It’ll just quietly become something you use 5x a day without realizing it.

At first, Meta tried to block the wins of OpenAI, Apple, and Google by going open-source with models like LLaMA trying to shape the game by being the ""open"" alternative.

But now, it's clear: Zuck knows that if Meta has to lead in the AI race, just shipping open-source models won’t cut it.

They’re losing the edge in product quality. LLaMA, Instagram’s AI features, anything Meta’s shipped, it’s nowhere close to GPT, Claude, or even Perplexity.

What does Zuck do next?

He does what he’s always done: hires.

Brings in ex-OpenAI engineers. Builds a “Superintelligence” team. 

And yes, he’s going all-in.

Meanwhile, Apple’s reportedly in talks to buy Perplexity.

This isn’t just OpenAI vs Google anymore.

It’s Apple vs Meta again. The same battle, a new arena.

Honestly, watching Zuck’s evolution over the last few years from the metaverse rabbit hole to now being super calculated and public-facing in AI is fascinating. He’s grown. He’s adapting.

This AI race isn’t just about models anymore. It’s about:

-Teams.

-Distribution.

-Interfaces.

And most interestingly, who builds the first AI-first social platform.

I do believe one will exist.

I don’t know what it will look like yet because if I did, I’d be building it already.

From “we won’t need new hardware” to “current computers were built for a world without AI,” the shift is loud and clear.

OpenAI is going to build its AI-native hardware and not just for the sake of experience.

Here’s the real play => OpenAI has no hardware distribution layer.

Meanwhile:
- Google owns Android
- Apple owns iPhones
- Microsoft owns Windows

 OpenAI? Just a layer on top of other people’s platforms.

That’s dangerous when you're building the most important interface shift in decades.

And with Jony Ive entering the scene, something is much more imminent

OpenAI isn’t just rethinking UX. It’s rethinking the entire device.

Because also a huge truth is, smartphone form factor was never meant for ambient, AI-first interaction.

Altman’s vision points toward something else:
- AI that’s aware of your environment
- Context-rich, voice-first, gesture-ready
- Less app-hopping, more fluid assistance
- A complete departure from glass rectangles and thumbs

If you want to win AI, you can't just own the model.

You have to own the medium. The interface. The distribution. That’s what this move is about.

We’re watching the beginning of OpenAI’s attempt to become the next Apple, but for AI.

Here’s why that should scare founders and excite strategists.

1.8 billion people use AI. But only 3% are paying. 

That's the paradox at consumer AI right now.

This stat should haunt every AI founder, product designer, and investor right now.

We’re witnessing one of the fastest tech adoptions in history 
- 61% of American adults have used AI in the last 6 months
- 600 million people globally use it every single day

And yet…
=> Only 3% are paying for it.

Even ChatGPT, the category leader, converts just 5% of weekly active users into subscribers.

Let that sink in.

What looks like scale is hiding one of the largest monetization gaps in consumer tech history.

But the issue isn’t demand. It’s behavior.

- People start with general AI assistants (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude).
- They stick with them by default, not because they’re perfect but because they’re good enough.
- Specialized tools only win when they’re 10x better for a very specific job.

The truth is, most AI tools today are assistants. Few are outcomes.

People don’t pay for “usage.” They pay for:
- Saving 3 hours a week on parenting chaos
- Getting their creative output to 10x polish
- Feeling less overwhelmed at work
- Solving something they’d normally outsource

The moment it feels useful, it becomes habitual.

The moment it saves you time and decision fatigue you pay.

The consumer AI opportunity isn’t just scale.

It’s building the first tool people trust enough to pay for, in high-friction moments they hate repeating.

We don’t need more playgrounds.

We need more AI tools that solve pain like aspirin.

Curious to hear from fellow founders and builders:
- Where do you see the biggest unlock?
- What would make you pay for an AI product every month?",29,5,0,3mo,Post,Siddharth Manjrekar,https://www.linkedin.com/in/thesidman,https://www.linkedin.com/in/thesidman/,2025-07-27T17:55:00.000Z,,2025-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-07-27

Data privacy, national security, and tech sovereignty are colliding again.

Germany has asked Apple and Google to ban DeepSeek over concerns around user data risk.

And this isn’t a one-off event. The pressure is mounting across Europe.

This could be the first domino to fall.

This isn't just about one AI app.

It’s about:
- A new AI Iron Curtain forming between East and West
- App stores becoming the new geopolitical frontlines
- The rise of “AI Nationalism” (data + intelligence = sovereignty)
- Increasing scrutiny over data lineage, model origin, and compute access

But here's a different lens:
The AI Cold War might birth a new class of decentralized, neutral AI infra — not owned by the US or China.

As nations pull their tech stacks apart, the demand for trusted, country-agnostic AI will explode.

Think: Open-source LLMs. Sovereign AI clouds. Localized inference layers. We’ll see the rise of companies that don’t compete on size, but on compliance, control, and cultural fit.

The AI race is no longer just about model performance.

It’s about control, transparency, ethics, and optionality.

We're watching AI go through what social media did a decade ago. Only this time, it's moving faster.

And the stakes are existential for businesses, governments, and citizens.

If you're building in AI right now, ask yourself:
>Is your product geopolitically safe?
>Is your data architecture legible and trusted?
>Can you thrive in a world where app stores become embassies?
>Can you be the Stripe or Cloudflare of “AI Sovereignty”?

Well, so I packed my bags, got some good alcohol for my Bangalore friends, cause that's what they ask you to get when you are coming from Goa. June 1st week spent talking to brands, marketing agency owners, and a few really smart people to understand how to build this further.

Guess what? we were wrong again! This time, what we had built did have a lot of value, did have users, but they were not ready to pay, or to put it better, pay enough.

Realised that we might need to pivot to a smaller segment of the ICP, which is Influencer Marketing agencies, logic? We were building a platform to manage, discover, and track your influencer marketing campaigns. naturally, marketing or influencer marketing agencies have a higher need for a solution like that, so I thought to sell it to them.

But realised that that makes the markets look way smaller, can't ever become a massive Billion Dollar company, and when that is what you have been dreaming of for a long enough of time, it fucking hurts.

But guess what, as a founder, your mind is trained to make 10 or 100 other doors when you see one of them is getting closed.

June 2nd and 3rd Week was spent getting deep into services as influencer marketing company, creating a productised structure, and the most valuable offer for the brands we want to work with.

Smart. Bold. Resourceful & most importantly crazy enough to build things that change the world.

That dream never really left me.

Today, I’m building a startup.
Not because it's cool. Not because it’s trending.
But because deep down, I want to create something that might actually matter.
Something that uses tech to help people live better, solve real problems, or spark a shift in how we think and live.

No, I don’t want to be a rich, arrogant genius.
I want to be the kind of builder who makes bold bets, learns fast, gives back, and leaves the world a bit better.

That’s the real arc reactor.

If you’re building something innovative, something that people might not understand yet, I’d love to connect. Let’s share war stories.

Back then, we were in our final year of college, exactly before the YC deadlines, when we had exams, submissions, and a lot of things going on simultaneously.

Fast forward to August, by the time we were done with the exam, it was too late, so we did a trip to Bangalore with a friend and mentor to get the understanding. That was my 1st time experiencing that city, and yes, it was amazing. 

When I was back in Goa, I was super pumped, energised, and was with full hunger to kill it, focused next 2 months building a significantly good product.

Guess what? it had a lot of go-to-market issues, spent the next 4-5 months in self-doubt, understanding what else to build, and still trying to make it work.

Now, cut to April 2025, we have little light of hope. We saw potential with the problem to solve, but the solution we had built back then was still a major issue, so we thought to change the way we solved this.

By May end, we had a network of 50000+ creators across India, with interest from a few brands to test and use it. 

Yes, it felt like a win, and I wanted to tell everyone that I am the next big thing that has happened to the startup ecosystem.

But that's exactly not where the story ends with a happy ending. What happens next is a good question to have, and you will have the answer to it in my next post.

Google has launched Gemma 3n, a lightweight AI model that can run offline on edge devices with just 2GB of RAM.

Yes, that means:
- AI in your pocket
- No cloud, no constant internet
- Fast, private, on-device intelligence
- Multimodal interaction (text, voice, image)

This isn't just another model release. This is a shift in how we’ll interact with 

AI going forward: ambient, local, personalized, and real-time. No lag, no latency, no cloud dependency.

We may be witnessing the beginning of:
 – AI-first smartphones
 – Wearables with true intelligence
 – Consumer electronics that feel alive
 – Tools that work even in remote, disconnected environments

Sure, Google may not be the company that defines this era.

But someone surely will.

This is the kind of shift where giants are born.

Gemma 3n is not the revolution. It’s the spark. 🔥

 Bharti Airtel is reportedly partnering with Elon Musk’s Starlink to bring high-speed satellite internet to the country.

This isn’t just another collab, it’s a potential leapfrog moment for India's internet infrastructure.

Starlink’s entry, backed by Airtel’s local might, could change the game for:
 📡 Remote villages with zero connectivity
 🏫 Schools, clinics, and rural enterprises stuck in digital darkness
 ⚡ Disaster-hit regions that need instant communication grids

This partnership means India’s last-mile connectivity problem might finally meet its match.

At first, Meta tried to block the wins of OpenAI, Apple, and Google by going open-source with models like LLaMA trying to shape the game by being the ""open"" alternative.

But now, it's clear: Zuck knows that if Meta has to lead in the AI race, just shipping open-source models won’t cut it.

They’re losing the edge in product quality. LLaMA, Instagram’s AI features, anything Meta’s shipped, it’s nowhere close to GPT, Claude, or even Perplexity.

What does Zuck do next?

He does what he’s always done: hires.

Brings in ex-OpenAI engineers. Builds a “Superintelligence” team. 

And yes, he’s going all-in.

Meanwhile, Apple’s reportedly in talks to buy Perplexity.

This isn’t just OpenAI vs Google anymore.

It’s Apple vs Meta again. The same battle, a new arena.

Honestly, watching Zuck’s evolution over the last few years from the metaverse rabbit hole to now being super calculated and public-facing in AI is fascinating. He’s grown. He’s adapting.

This AI race isn’t just about models anymore. It’s about:

-Teams.

-Distribution.

-Interfaces.

And most interestingly, who builds the first AI-first social platform.

I do believe one will exist.

I don’t know what it will look like yet because if I did, I’d be building it already.

The digital landscape is saturated.
AI-generated ads are everywhere.
Yet, trust is at an all-time low, and CAC keeps climbing.

Yes, some ads convert. But the conversions rarely compound.
Brands are chasing clicks, not building lasting equity.

Here’s the core issue:
We’re optimizing for short-term wins, not long-term growth.

The answer? Surprisingly, it's not new.
It’s influencer marketing done right.
Not the bloated, overhyped campaigns.
But lean, trust-first, performance-led creator collaborations.

- We help brands activate both barter and paid influencer campaigns
- Even barter deals are driving real conversions
- We’re building influencer marketing as a profit-positive channel, not a brand expense

After 2 years of testing and refining, we’ve built a system that makes this channel deliver, not just impressions, but outcomes.

If you’re looking to cut through the noise, build trust, and drive real growth, this is the channel to bet on.

Well, so I packed my bags, got some good alcohol for my Bangalore friends, cause that's what they ask you to get when you are coming from Goa. June 1st week spent talking to brands, marketing agency owners, and a few really smart people to understand how to build this further.

Guess what? we were wrong again! This time, what we had built did have a lot of value, did have users, but they were not ready to pay, or to put it better, pay enough.

Realised that we might need to pivot to a smaller segment of the ICP, which is Influencer Marketing agencies, logic? We were building a platform to manage, discover, and track your influencer marketing campaigns. naturally, marketing or influencer marketing agencies have a higher need for a solution like that, so I thought to sell it to them.

But realised that that makes the markets look way smaller, can't ever become a massive Billion Dollar company, and when that is what you have been dreaming of for a long enough of time, it fucking hurts.

But guess what, as a founder, your mind is trained to make 10 or 100 other doors when you see one of them is getting closed.

June 2nd and 3rd Week was spent getting deep into services as influencer marketing company, creating a productised structure, and the most valuable offer for the brands we want to work with.

""Product is marketing.""

And instantly, one brand flashed in my mind: Sega.

Not the gaming console.
The sports shoes brand that every kid in my 6th-grade football team was wearing.

Cheap. No ads. No influencers. No ""Just Do It.""

But everyone wore it. And to be honest
I still trust Sega more than most new sportswear brands.

Even today:
- If I want something premium, I’ll pick Nike, Puma, or Reebok.
- But if I just want a product that works, Sega wins. Everytime!

Why?
Because Sega isn’t just a product. It’s an emotion.
It’s that reliable, no-fuss, rugged shoe that became the uniform of the underdogs.
No campaigns. Just pure distribution + quality + mass trust.

And that’s the point Mukesh Bansal was making 
Your product is your loudest marketing channel.

I know for some people this might not be the most relevant example, but the summary is..

Make something so obviously good that it speaks louder than your campaigns.

And maybe... that’s what we need to remember more often in this age of AI-generated ads and CAC charts.

But if you think your Product is absolutely good, but you need help with marketing, do reach out.

The digital landscape is saturated.
AI-generated ads are everywhere.
Yet, trust is at an all-time low, and CAC keeps climbing.

Yes, some ads convert. But the conversions rarely compound.
Brands are chasing clicks, not building lasting equity.

Here’s the core issue:
We’re optimizing for short-term wins, not long-term growth.

The answer? Surprisingly, it's not new.
It’s influencer marketing done right.
Not the bloated, overhyped campaigns.
But lean, trust-first, performance-led creator collaborations.

- We help brands activate both barter and paid influencer campaigns
- Even barter deals are driving real conversions
- We’re building influencer marketing as a profit-positive channel, not a brand expense

After 2 years of testing and refining, we’ve built a system that makes this channel deliver, not just impressions, but outcomes.

If you’re looking to cut through the noise, build trust, and drive real growth, this is the channel to bet on.

Well, so I packed my bags, got some good alcohol for my Bangalore friends, cause that's what they ask you to get when you are coming from Goa. June 1st week spent talking to brands, marketing agency owners, and a few really smart people to understand how to build this further.

Guess what? we were wrong again! This time, what we had built did have a lot of value, did have users, but they were not ready to pay, or to put it better, pay enough.

Realised that we might need to pivot to a smaller segment of the ICP, which is Influencer Marketing agencies, logic? We were building a platform to manage, discover, and track your influencer marketing campaigns. naturally, marketing or influencer marketing agencies have a higher need for a solution like that, so I thought to sell it to them.

But realised that that makes the markets look way smaller, can't ever become a massive Billion Dollar company, and when that is what you have been dreaming of for a long enough of time, it fucking hurts.

But guess what, as a founder, your mind is trained to make 10 or 100 other doors when you see one of them is getting closed.

June 2nd and 3rd Week was spent getting deep into services as influencer marketing company, creating a productised structure, and the most valuable offer for the brands we want to work with. 

Now, why are we doing this, and how is that a different value proper from any other agency? we will surely talk about it more in the next few posts.

For context, we started working on Frover when we were in the 7th sem of our college, the problem statement was very simple, their is no single platform that directly onboards the brands and the creators and allows them to directly interact with each other, along with providing the support for the creator analytics, and the understanding about how the campaigns are performing to the brand. Basically, a marketplace and analytics platform.

There were competitors who were doing similar, who were building something slightly different, but less powerful, and we thought that it leaves us room to build a very-very superior product and solve for the market. (No doubt we were very much correct about this.)

Around 6 months back, when we started getting a few creators onboard and talked to brands, tried doing few beta users, we realised there is a slight misalignment.. 

So here's a bit of theory, all marketplace platforms work because of distribution and not the tech part of it.. In our case specifically the brand for sure wanted to use the product, and features when it had enough number of creators, but without creators it was all useless.

And why were we not able to onboard creators? it was a combination of reasons, but the most probable one was their habit; they are more than comfortable in current scheme of things, and the solution didnt offered an instant delta to the user on the influencer side. 

But good, high-paying brand deals weren't enough for Delta for creators?

We were in the middle of this classic chicken and egg problem, which all people who wish to create marketplaces face. Brands weren't there because there were no creators, and for creators to onboard on a platform which do not have enough brand deals is a bit too much friction. Brands beyond that wanted us to come in as an agency and solve things for them.. 

Lesson learnt?

One of the biggest shifts I’ve had while building in Goa —
Stop falling in love with the solution.
Start falling in love with solving the problem.
Sounds simple.
But this tiny mental switch changed how I think, how I build, and how I lead.
Earlier, I’d get so attached to the thing we were building — every button, feature, idea felt sacred.
Now?
If it doesn’t serve the core problem… it’s gone.
Dropped some thoughts in this video on how this shift happened for me — and why I think it’s one of the most underrated lessons for early-stage founders.

A lot of the people who have come to us, to use Frover, an Influencer marketplace and analytics platform, have been very specifically the people who just want to get started with creator marketing. 

Most of them are D2C brands in the very initial phases of their life or local businesses. 

And at enough times, we have told them not to get into creator marketing at this point.

A lot of people say creator marketing is like steroids to social media marketing, but I would slightly disagree with that.. 

The exact word is something like Protein. 

The super important, most essential piece of your social media marketing strategy. 

And a reason we often tell our clients to not use our platform now is because they mostly have very little or no social presence, in which case creator marketing will not work.

A simple analogy to this is how you build your body not only by eating protein but by working out. Ofc eating enough protein, and taking supplements is the key part, but you can't skip the foundations of working out.

Think about it: In a country where emergency response times are often the difference between life and death, this could be a game-changer. Blinkit is starting small, with five ambulances kitted out with paramedics, assistants, and life-saving gear. But the impact? Potentially massive.

And while some folks are debating, ""Can you trust an app in a medical emergency?"" or ""Will this actually work beyond a pilot?""—I’m sitting here like, “Hey, at least someone’s trying to innovate!” Because honestly, if grocery delivery can be instant, why not life-saving delivery?

Here’s the thing: This isn’t just a tech moment; this is a human moment. It’s about businesses recognizing their power to solve real problems, beyond profits and ads. It’s ambitious, it’s bold, and yeah, it’s risky—but isn’t that how the biggest changes start?

Now, I have more to say about this (and a few wild ideas of my own). Sharing my unfiltered thoughts in the video attached—don’t miss it. I’d love to hear what you think: Is this the future of emergency care or just a flash in the pan?

P.S. On a personal note, building Frover these past few months has been like riding a rollercoaster with no seatbelt—exhilarating, exhausting, and consuming all at once. But hey, no complaints—it’s all part of the grind, right?

I’ve been so out of the loop here on LinkedIn, but I promise to show up more often now.

Recently, I gave them a sample photo of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, and the result was stunning. 

Snapchat’s ability to innovate in AR and VR really sets them apart from competitors. They’re also heavily investing in AI, which adds an entirely new layer of possibilities.

With the world having a text-to-image moment for text-to-3D model creation. It would be incredibly easy to design immersive AR filters and even entire virtual worlds within them. The potential is endless, and the speed of innovation is only accelerating.

Historically, during major technological revolutions, it’s been the interface companies that come out on top. But I believe the convergence of AR, VR, and AI is going to reshape everything. For the first time in human history, we have technology that challenges not only our cognitive abilities but also our capacity for both the quality and quantity of work, along with how we see and interact with the world changing.

That’s why I think this revolution will play out differently. Smaller, underdog companies could outperform the giants. 

A great example is Anthropic, which has outpaced OpenAI in terms of speed, accuracy, and innovation.

I could be wrong, but I can’t help but be amazed by what Snapchat is doing with its filters—it really highlights the exciting future ahead.",6,0,0,1yr,Post,Siddharth Manjrekar,https://www.linkedin.com/in/thesidman,https://www.linkedin.com/in/thesidman/,2025-10-25T17:56:00.000Z,,2024-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,,,2024-10-25
