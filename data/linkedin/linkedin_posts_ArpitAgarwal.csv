Do you actually remember any of it?
Yeah‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt think so.

We consume 8x more content than our parents but retain about 3x less. Something broke.

Why?
Because we didn‚Äôt evolve formats.
We kicked off a dopamine arms race with passive consumption. 

Watch the evolution driven purely by engagement:

1990s: Text-first platforms (blogs, forums) 
2004: Facebook launches with text status updates 
2010: Instagram goes image-first ‚Üí 1B users 
2016: TikTok goes video-first ‚Üí reshapes everything

And the same story, told today?
Text (0.1% engagement) ‚Üí Image (0.3%) ‚Üí Video (0.7%) ‚Üí Bitsized video (2.5%)

Then came the panic pivots:
 - Instagram adds Reels 6 months after TikTok explodes
 - LinkedIn mimics TikTok, despite being ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù
 - YouTube launches Shorts to keep up

Every leap in format = more stimulation.
And now? 
We're in full-blown jittery goldfish mode.

Because here‚Äôs the punchline: 
Engagement went up. Retention flatlined..

Twitch‚Äôs ""I'm Only Sleeping"" category (where literally streamers do nothing) logged over 4.1M hours watched in just the last 30 days.

My co-founder Sangrish Saigiridhar often codes with random YouTube videos quietly playing in the background. People binge 6+ hours a day but can‚Äôt even recall what they watched yesterday.

Meanwhile, brands are investing $247B in social media video ads last year. Yet, 45% of viewers watched less than a minute.

We're overstimulating dopamine receptors‚Äîcreating consumption without comprehension.

Here‚Äôs the kicker:
- Attention spans dropped 25% during the video boom
- Video takes 5x the effort of text, gets consumed in ~8 second bites

David Foster Wallace saw this coming: ""The real question is how to stay alive while drowning in stimuli.""

So here‚Äôs my take:
The next breakout format? It won‚Äôt crank up the volume.
 It‚Äôll solve engagement fatigue.

Some of the sharpest founders I know are already betting against passive consumption.

So let me ask: What do you think is the next big content format?

I've always questioned the effort-to-impact ratio in this endless digital noise, yet consumption has become our collective addiction:

-  An avg social media user scrolls through over 300 ft (~ height of Statue of Liberty) daily, while brands poured $276B into ads chasing those eyeballs last year

- There are 207 million active content creators today and 54% of businesses plan to boost content spend

Today's content battle is fought on two fronts: volume and authenticity.

Volume constraints are visibly falling ‚Äî just as 150 years ago steam-powered looms multiplied cloth output 500x per worker, modern tools (from TikTok to OpenAI‚Äôs GPT) have dramatically compressed production time for blogs, images, and videos.

But here's the paradox that keeps me up: unlike factory goods, content thrives on subjectivity and for me, it is always about the highest wisdom-to-word ratio. MrBeast didn't rack up 83B views by standardization ‚Äî he succeeded by being unapologetically original.

This brings us to one of the defining creative challenges of our time: How do you automate something that requires human originality?

It's not just a technical hurdle ‚Äî it's a communication one. After millennia of struggling to express ourselves to other humans (just ask any relationship therapist üòÖ), we're now trying to brief machines with prompts and expect art in return.

Let's be honest ‚Äî your best AI result isn't ""one prompt and done."" It's a dialogue. And often a time taking one.

As this relationship evolves, I wonder: will AI become more intuitive to our creative needs, or will we develop new muscles to converse with our digital collaborators? Chances are, both ‚Äî through mutual adaptation.

So before the singularity arrives, what do you look for in an AI creative companion to swipe right? üëÄ
