Here’s the short version.

We set out to build a platform, an ""AI Agent design studio"" built on custom Agentic framework—something more deliberate than a mere chatbot and more capable than a rule-based workflow. 

The goal was straightforward: create agents that can observe, reason, take action, and keep getting better.

What that means in practice:

- Multimodal by default: voice, video, and text all handled natively.

- Tool-ready: the agent can reach into real systems—CRMs, HR platforms, data stores—and do actual work.

- Memory that lasts: context isn’t reset every time the conversation ends; it compounds.

Businesses don't just work on code and software, they depend on a whole lot—telephony, video systems, hardware and a lot of operations. 

We have built everything on one platform. Stiched actual components that power businesses and operations.

We’re now in the final stretch. The system is functional, modular, and nearly live.

A few reflections from the build-out:

Architecture matters more than model size. An elegant separation between perception, cognition, and action solves problems brute force never will.

Guardrails aren’t an afterthought. Real-world agents need business logic and ethical constraints baked in from day one.

Usefulness beats novelty every time. If an agent can’t close a loop—hire the candidate, resolve the ticket, finish the analysis, sell something—it isn’t worth shipping.

Soon I’ll share details and lessons learned, but for now I wanted to give you—the people who have traded notes, challenged assumptions, and offered early feedback—a look behind the curtain.

If you’re also pushing toward autonomous agents—or wrestling with how to apply them to hiring, support, sales, or research—I’d love to compare experiences. Feel free to reach out.

While some traditional roles are being phased out, entirely new ones are emerging at an incredible pace.

Roles like AI Ethicist, Virtual Reality Designer, Human-Machine Teaming Manager, Data Privacy Officer, and AI Trainer are gaining momentum. Are these the jobs of the future? The demand suggests so.

For freshers and grads, this is the perfect time to explore these opportunities. The key? Upskilling and reskilling. I am personally seeing the job market changing rapidly first hand, and in my opinion, those who stay curious and adaptable will thrive.

Change is inevitable—let’s embrace it and build careers that drive innovation!
