AI is changing how we work, and it's redefining what makes a great PM.

1. Builder > Supervisor. Your ability to directly create value now matters more than your org chart position. 

2. New Scoreboard. Revenue per headcount is the metric that matters. When AI compresses cost/time per feature, productivity per person becomes everything.

3. The hierarchy of skills is changing. Judgment at the top, creativity and problem-solving in the middle, execution (increasingly AI-assisted) at the bottom

For this project, I framed a problem statement around something I personally face as a multi-passionate person managing multiple projects. ""Juggling multiple passions often means constant context switching, recalling where you left off, rebuilding momentum, and re-entering the right headspace. This repeated friction drains time, disrupts flow, and makes pursuing diverse passions overwhelming. Despite the growing number of multi-passionate individuals, there is still a need for a simple personalized tool to help transition smoothly between contexts .""

To my astonishment, v0 was able to deliver a working prototype in just 4 minutes 31 seconds, with an impressive UI that came with editable design systems for typography, color palettes, and layouts. What surprised me the most was suggested changes were implemented in only 42 seconds. The little details it had added like ""The context switch assistant, exit notes, preparing to switch contexts (also allowing the user to take time before switching)"", then the copy ""Currently creating magic with : The project name"" on the top left side, also indicating the WIP, left me awestruck.

Wrapped up an incredible Advanced AI Product Management course journey last month at pmcurve – but this wasn't just about learning. We built a real product, solved a real problem, and got real users. 💪 

🩺 The Challenge: 
Teamed up with fellow Toastmaster Deepak Valusa to tackle a pain point we both felt deeply – the tedious process of publishing meeting minutes in Toastmasters clubs.

🩸 The Journey: 
I'll be honest – I had serious doubts about technical feasibility. Could we actually pull this off?

This is where everything came together: 
→ Deepak Singh's mentorship kept us focused on what mattered 
→ His Structured course content gave us the foundation 
→ An incredible community pushed us forward when we hit walls

Countless hours. Multiple iterations. Product-sense decisions at every turn.

💊 The Result:
 ✅ Product ready for real-world use
 ✅ First customer acquired 
 ✅ High ratings from both judges AND audience at capstone demo day

🧘‍♂️ The Big Takeaway: 
Even in the AI world, product sense drives 80% of success. Technology enables, but understanding your user's problem is what wins.

🕴‍ Toastmasters friends: 
If your club publishes meeting minutes, I'd love for you to try out our application and share your feedback. Let's make club operations smoother together.

Here is why - there are two goals of writing a PRD:

1. Thinking long and hard about what you need to build

2. Sharing requirements with others 

#1 is primary goal, #2 is secondary. Writing is a tool for thinking, possibly the best tool for thinking clearly as it eliminates gaps in thinking. And so taken that way, writing a PRD is pretty important. So why is AI prototyping so appealing?

AI prototypes are good for sharing requirements with others in a limited time environment like leadership meetings for buy-in, business, etc. But many things can be lost in translation if engineering or design teams start taking AI prototypes as source of truth.

Evals are QA testing for AI products. We all are familiar with QA testing since every software company does it. Now the question becomes - why is it coming to PMs rather than setting a dedicated QA team for it?

Here is the reason for it: AI product output is probabilistic whereas software is deterministic. What it means is that software will behave in the same way every time. A button when clicked by 1000s of users will open a modal all thousands of times. But the same prompt used by 1000s of users may provide different responses to different users. That makes testing AI products difficult. It needs to be initially done by someone who understands how AI works, has the context of what users will like or not like, etc. That sort of context is not there with a QA team, so PMs have to do it initially. 

Once the product gets stable and PMs understand the patterns, they can design guidelines on how to test this product. That’s where you set up an evals/ QA team.

Now there are other nuances in the process: like hiring expertise for complex tasks, golden sets, etc. But they can all common sense and be derived for a product as long as you understand that evals is QA and how QA is different for AI vs Software products.",221,13,1,1mo,Post,Deepak Singh,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak1907,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak1907/,2025-09-22T15:31:00.000Z,,2025-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-09-22

Teaching has been a privilege for me.

It’s a way to transfer my learning to more people so that they can succeed where I failed, and excel where I struggled. As a manager, you are taught to make your teams capable so that the leverage is stronger. I see teaching as that sort of creating leverage in the ecosystem and positive change in society at large. 

It’s a learning opportunity for me because while it’s been easy to write small posts on social media, it’s really hard to sit in a room full of experienced product leaders and teach them few things I know. It pushes me to think longer and harder about problems I talk about because if you lack depth, they will see through it. 

Most importantly, I enjoy it and get energy from it. Teaching PM professionals is rewarding because the impact is clear and near term. 

I have also come to believe that there is a teacher in all of us. It comes in front of our children, teams, siblings, friends, etc in the form of advice or guidance.

1. Marginal cost of query can be optimised: This one has been called out by many thought leaders. Marginal cost of query is additional cost of serving another query to the end user. By having a single model (GPT-5), ChatGPT can route simple queries to cheaper models, thereby reducing marginal cost. Earlier, if a user selected a particular model, ChatGPT had to use that much compute. 

2. Simple wins in consumer products: With ChatGPT crossing billions of users, it has to start thinking about the type of user who prefers simplicity over options. This is the late majority on the adoption curve and they don’t want to think much while asking a query. Think Google Search, Tiktok, and WhatsApp where simplicity is an advantage in consumer apps space.

3. Personalisation of queries will create moats: I have been a heavy user of LLMs since the start, partly because a big part of my current role is deep research of products and domains. I also ask the same question using different prompts and go deeper more often than not. Once ChatGPT understands this, it can add a signal in my profile where it activates deep research/ advanced models when I ask a query. The result? I feel it gets my queries and my switching cost increases. Now, replicate the same for a user who prefers simple language responses. ChatGPT writes responses in simple language for the users. With this, we are going to see a level of personalisation never seen before. Let’s call it ‘token level personalisation’. So far, we have seen only fixed entity (shopping item, web page, video, etc) level personalisation. Token level personalisation is going to be at a different level.",46,6,2,1mo,Post,Deepak Singh,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak1907,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak1907/,2025-09-22T15:31:00.000Z,,2025-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-09-22

The science is clear: journaling works. But the act itself can be intimidating and lonely. It’s a journey we're often expected to navigate without a map.

Yesterday, I conducted a live session around vibe-coding products. 

Here are 7 counterintuitive lessons from the session you won't hear in most places👇

1. Write The v1 of PRDs manually

From my experience, PMs who remember key metrics without relying on dashboards think more critically and connect data points faster. Apply the same principle to PRDs: draft the first basic version manually to exercise and show product intuition, then refine with AI.

2. AI apps need to manage stakes/ risks in products

In high-stakes domains like education or healthcare, unchecked AI output can mislead users. A safer approach is routing it through experts first—for example, in our EdTech Q&A app, instructors review AI answers before students see them.

3. Bug-fixing skills aren't major win for PMs

Prototypes break when you are building them during the interviews, and the response matters more than the resolution. PMs are judged on problem-solving skills and understanding of tech/ issues, not debugging when it comes to PMs. 

4. Functional prototypes don't equate to production-ready code

When it comes to AI prototypes, the scaling is the easy bit. The core problems are around tech debt, security, compliance, etc. That's why it shouldn't be put in production without proper review.

5. Slow is Fast with LLMs

How do we make sure that the tool like Lovable is just modifying what we told it to and nothing more? The answer is patience. When modifying requirements, we need to first confirm if it understood the changes by asking it to describe the changes. No coding in this step, just chat. Only after that, we should authorise changes.

If you go for speed by doing it all in a single step, it can often result in more time spent fixing bugs.

6. Sequential approach > one-shot

You might develop an urge to put the entire MVP req at one in the tool. But there are two problems with that: First, attempting to build the whole thing increases bugs/failure probability. Second, it's harder to figure out the bugs in a large codebase.
Instead, take a sequential approach: Start at the core functionalities -> Add the AI features -> Build the adjacent layers next, such as authentication layer

7. Have an annual learning budget

""How many tools do we pay for to learn? It’s quite expensive.”

Have a $300-$500 per annum budget for the next two years. The flux is really high in terms of tools and skills. The only way to stay relevant is to master the tools and skills. You can always cancel subscriptions you don’t like. After all, the best investment you can make today is in your skills, body, and mind!

Companies have started adding AI prototyping as a core skill for PMs, both on the job and in the interviews. 

Contrary to a popular belief which separates interviewing skills with real skills on a job, both reinforce each other. 

Why this topic matters now: You will feel good and be productive. Moreover, your team and manager expects you to master this.

If you build without learning much, you end up making mistakes and lag behind from some competitor who made the right call. The loop of build and then learn could be expensive.

It you keep learning without building, learning becomes a procrastination tool and counterproductive because there is something new to learn everyday in AI.

I faced the problem myself, and here is what worked  - Start with the problem and work backwards on what to learn!

Step 1: Take a problem, put it in the best LLM model you have access to, and ask for which things you should be learning. 

Step 2: Don’t use LLMs to learn the topics: go to the source and read please. It’s cumbersome but extremely important.

Step 3: Come back to LLMs and use them as a research and thinking tool to build solution.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7359810676552294400,,Text,"""Build all table stakes, and differentiate on some."" Is it a good product strategy? 

On the first level, it looks correct because if you follow it, it will help you differentiate and win.

But real-life product development is messy and there is always competition. Building all table stakes makes you slow, and your product positioning suffers because of it.

Here's what's better:
- Build some table stakes
- Intentionally under-invest in features your segment doesn't value
- Make one/few features absolutely incredible

A user doesn't want everything. They want their biggest pain solved in the best manner. 

That's why even the most comprehensive platforms like Salesforce loses deals to startups like Gong because Gong does one thing better - revenue intelligence.

So how do you fix this? First, it's important to realise that the ambition to do everything comes from the lack of the insight. It can happen on two fronts: who you customer is and who isn't, and what their major pain is. The lack of insight (and answer to both questions) comes from talking to customers.

Talking to customers is a necessary, but not sufficient. There is a good chance they will ask for everything. You have to introspect and see where to focus - this is the core of product strategy. It's good to remember what Jobs said - 

“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”",32,4,2,2mo,Post,Deepak Singh,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak1907,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak1907/,2025-08-23T15:31:00.000Z,,2025-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-08-23

We hear that AI has no moat. And anyone can copy your ChatGPT wrapper.

But here's what they're missing!

Traditional software is deterministic. You can reverse-engineer features and rebuild them exactly. That's why, in the era of software, distribution has been a key moat. 

But what about AI products? They're probabilistic in nature, it's hard to reverse engineer them by looking at output. The final product depends on hundreds of decisions

- How you cleaned your data
- Which edge cases you prioritized
- The specific prompts + policy you refined over months
- The proprietary data/ insights from the user feedback loops
- Latency
- Evals
- Tooling, and many more decisions

And this is where startups like Anthropic beat big-tech benchmarks on coding agents. They made thousands of small decisions that compound into something unique - and it's hard to reverse engineer all of these things by looking from outside. 

The moat isn't the code. It's the speed of iterations, insights, and processes - all of which are tacit and path dependent.

I have been reading papers to understand AI deeply. My brain works better when I take notes and explain while reading a paper. Abstract in simple language: 

""With MCP, the ability to integrate more tools to build complex AI applications is going to increase over time. 

Selecting the right tool for the job is extremely important for building reliable apps/ agents. So we include the info on how to select the right tool in the  prompt of the LLM. Every tool integration requires changes in the master prompt of LLM, and this creates a major problem.

Adding info around more tools can lead to bloating of master prompt. Now, we know from another paper that as prompts get longer, their efficiency (ability of AI to follow instructions precisely) degrades. So while longer prompts can provide more context and improve results, they can also introduce noise and degrade performance. RAG-MCP aims to solve this. 

RAG-MCP is a new kind of architecture (fancy term for system design) proposed in the paper. We offload the task of finding the right tool to RAG. Only the selected tool descriptions are passed to the model, drastically reducing prompt size and simplifying decision-making. 

---

My view is that this is a quite important paper since it makes an agent scalable and efficient. 

I also thought sharing summary notes once in a while will push more PMs/ engineers to read papers. Do let me know how you find it.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358010539161104386,,Article,"Just wrapped up a live session on ""How to Vibe-Code in PM Interviews with AI"" last Saturday and wanted to share the key insights.

For context - this is the first episode of our ""How to X with AI"" series at pmcurve. You can follow updates by subscribing to the channel/ newsletter.

Here are the key insights from the session:

Certain aspects of PM role are changing fast: Google's recent shift from ""writing-first"" to ""building-first"" culture isn't just a Google thing. It's happening everywhere.

Vibe-Coding is now a core PM skill: Think of it like user segmentation or success metrics - it's becoming table stakes. Companies aren't testing if you can use tools like Claude or Lovable. They're testing if you can think like a PM while building these prototypes.

The framework for vibe-coding: Jumping straight into prototyping is a mistake, both in full time role and in interviews. We discuss the framework around it in the session, and it’s pretty similar to product sense/ design problems. Most PMs miss this. They go straight to building the prototype (""creating a feedback form"") without asking WHO it's for or WHY we're building it.

Being tool agnostic: You need 2-3 diverse tools in your arsenal. For example, one could be Lovable for building end-to-end apps. Another could be Claude for reasoning and creating clean UI. And a third can be Replit for AI agent development of apps. Hiring managers care if you can show product sense, build quick prototypes, focus on what matters, and debug when things go wrong.

Most Prompt Engineering advice is shallow for PMs: Most prompt engineering advice comes in the form of ""give it a persona"" - “be clear and specific” - “add examples”. PMs have to get complex things done. The advice here is to go deeper. Read the actual research papers on techniques such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thought, etc.

Show deep PM skills, not speed: The best signal you can give to the hiring manager isn’t how many features you know of a tool. Comment on your design choices while building. Fact-check LLM outputs. Show how you handle when AI goes haywire. That's what separates good PMs from average ones.

To summarise, vibe coding interviews are about testing if you can 3-4x your productivity as a PM. Master the fundamentals - product sense, technical system design, RCA skills. Then layer AI tools on the top.

Not all product magic comes from writing perfect PRDs. Sometimes it’s about feeling the pulse — of users, markets, and even LLMs.
I've been exploring what I call “Vibe Coding for PMs” — a blend of design intuition, smart prompting, and live feedback shaping.

Here’s what I’ve learned:
🧠 Ask better questions → before building anything
 🧩 Think in systems → not just screens
 🎯 Align features to goals → revenue, CSAT, or retention
 💬 Use LLMs not as writers, but as thought partners
 🎨 Prototype not to impress — but to understand
And the coolest part?
You don’t need to be an engineer or a Figma pro. Just start catching the vibe:
✅ Observe the user journey noise
✅ Decode what’s truly broken
✅ Use AI tools to shape fast, test early, and listen better

Vibe Coding is more than prototyping — it’s a mindset shift:

From ""what should we build?"" to ""what signals are we missing?""
This mindset has made me 10x more aware, faster to iterate, and sharper at prioritizing.

Because at the end of the day, great PMs don’t just ship features—they catch the vibe before the user even speaks. 

Big thanks to Deepak Singh and pmcurve for inspiring this evolution.

Technology has accelerated exponentially in recent years, and generative AI has turbocharged this growth even further.

A few years ago, I read about Ola's founding story and was deeply inspired by how Bhavish Aggarwal and @Ankit Bhati built their empire from scratch—one focused on operations and customer relations while the other handled technology. Back then, I had my own idea for a peer-to-peer ride-sharing app, but as someone from a non-tech background, the complexity of app development felt overwhelming. I shelved the idea and continued my studies.

Recently, I completed an AI prototyping course by Deepak Singh, and witnessing how AI can transform simple prompts into working applications completely amazed me.

That's when my peer-to-peer car sharing idea resurfaced. Using Lovable.dev, I turned my concept into a functional prototype with just a few well-crafted prompts! 🚗

The journey from idea to prototype: ✅ Created a comprehensive PRD ✅ Built separate host and guest interfaces
 ✅ Developed car listing functionality with multiple image uploads ✅ Implemented search and filter capabilities ✅ Added multi-currency support

Key takeaway: AI has eliminated the technical barriers that once stood between great ideas and their execution. What took months of development and significant investment can now be prototyped in hours.

The democratization of technology means that domain expertise and creativity matter more than coding skills. If you have an idea that's been sitting on the back burner, now might be the perfect time to dust it off.

What ideas have you been postponing due to technical constraints? The tools are here—the question is, are you ready to take the leap?

As a PM reading this paper, here are my top 3 takeaways:

1. The paper focusses tons on the novel evaluation method where they used puzzles like Towers of Hanoi (CS101 problem) with increasing complexity. I have seen PMs asking about how to be best at evals - which is the core job of an AI PM. The research methodology helped me understand how to write evals for a novel situation. So yeah, one way to be the best would be to read these papers.

2. The paper talks about where reasoning LLMs shine, and where they don't. For simpler problems, standard LLMs demonstrate greater efficiency and accuracy. As problem complexity increases, thinking models gain an advantage. However, when problems reach high complexity, both model types experience complete performance collapse. As a PM, it helps me optimise costs of serving a query by routing queries to appropriate model based on their complexities. Better to build a classifier than burn tons of money!

3. It questions the current evaluation benchmark for the reasoning models. From the paper, ""We show that state-of-the-art LRMs (e.g., o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking) still fail to develop generalizable problem-solving capabilities, with accuracy ultimately collapsing to zero beyond certain complexities across different environments"". It seems that this is a fundamental limitation, and newer models wouldn't be able to solve it via inference/ compute. So as PMs, whatever projections we are making in complex task resolution due to future model improvements needs to account for this. 

All in all, a pretty refreshing paper. I look forward to more such paper which plays the devil's advocate in the hyped world of AI.",42,4,1,3mo,Post,Deepak Singh,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak1907,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak1907/,2025-07-24T15:31:00.000Z,,2025-07-17T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-07-24

The first one is the popular one - how is Google Search is going to evolve in the face of LLMs whose form factor takes away their ad revenue? It's not a new question for Google as people tend to believe. The question started with the Google Assistant in 2016. An assistant, by definition, eats into search revenue. 

The second one is the less popular one, but equally important - what's Apple strategy going to be around AI? It doesn't have the lead or the best talent. Moreover, it doesn't seem to be in a hurry to build LLMs. Rather, it is talking to various players like Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT to make a deal. With all the resources, a good question to ask is why Apple isn't building it on their own. Is it that they can't, or they don't want to? At this point, the answer looks latter because it doesn't threatens Apple's business model. 

And then there is ChatGPT - the most loved consumer company in the domain. Their history keeps creating challenging strategic questions for them.

I had two immediate, unrelated thoughts while going through it.

First, it doesn't seem true. The hiring manager rounds happen at Google for team matching, and aren't a part of initial set of 4-5 rounds. They happen after the candidate has cleared the initial rounds. 

Second, I do see a vibe-coding round coming soon for AI PM roles, and possibly even non-AI PM roles. The reason is pretty simple - for the first time in the history of product management, we don't have to rely on subjective questions to see what a candidate can do. A vibe-coding round can reveal their technical know-how, design sensibilities, and decision-making.

Do you need to learn to code? No. Do you need to understand how technical systems work, how bugs get resolved, etc.. The answer is YES!

Great products don't ask users to become prompt engineers. They understand intent and fill in the gaps automatically.

So, crafted an Agentic AI Workflow (n8n)with specialised agents:

1. Planner: Understands what you're asking ( Sonnet 4 for thinking )
2. Crawler: Finds relevant information automatically
3. Formatter: Structures data meaningfully
4. Compiler: Synthesises insights
5. Publisher: Delivers actionable results

The Result?
You search like you always have. The system handles the context. The intelligence flows naturally.

Case in point
Input to the workflow - Early child development program and its effect on the brain
Output - 1 using GPT_4.1_mini and another using Claude Sonnet 3.5 . I liked the output from Claude's output- well-researched and well-formatted.

Which one did you like?

""We find that having access to Copilot induces such individuals to shift task allocation towards their core work of coding activities and away from non-core project management activities.

With AI, PMs are going to have time to go deeper into core activities like gathering insights from user research and data, industry and competition, and building product strategy for the long term.

Learning the ropes of product management at your job is a good strategy.

1. There is no better medium to get feedback from one human than another human. People fill surveys mindlessly. When you call customers, they engage much more of their brainpower. This means better articulation and much more thought through responses.

2. The nuances in data is the key when it comes to building conviction. Doing 1:1 means you can go back and forth on assumptions. What’s more? You have lots of data around tone, facial expressions, and little details. AI can read and summarise text, so by the time you are reading reviews summary, the feedback has lost 90% of signal. 

3. Creative problem solving. This is a point only those who have done good amount of 1:1 conversations with users will understand. When you are listening to customers, your brain goes into creative problem solving mode. You can have ideas and inspiration throughout the process that is hard to come by when reading a report generated by AI.

So how do you avoid that? We recommend this 3 step-process that excellent AI builders use!

Let's first understand the key reasons listed for these project cancellations? High costs and unclear business value!

Most AI projects in organisations right now are in experimental phase. There is also a lot of hype around what AI can and can't do. When it comes to agents, average assistant products are masquerading as AI agents. From the report, ""Only about 130 of the thousands of agentic AI vendors are real. Many vendors are engaging in 'agent washing' - the rebranding of products such as AI assistants and chatbots without significant agentic capabilities.""

It's an interesting report to come at a time when everyone is promising agents as a magic bullet to solve real business problems. 

What the report doesn't talk about is how to separate what's real from hype. Further, what should you do if you are building an AI agent to avoid this fate. Here are 3 steps I would recommend you to do:

1. Start by looking at independent startups/companies solving the use-case you are going after. For example, suppose you want to build an agent for Sales. Look at the companies already doing something similar (Gong, Salesforce, etc). Take their demos and understand those products. Don't start on a use-case without proper research across India, US, and China markets. If no one is doing what you are thinking, the product feasibility might be low. It's a signal to go deeper into feasibility of the AI use-case. The shortcut to evaluate feasibility is to find a friend or mentor or industry expert who understands AI well, and seek their advice.

2. Create the PRD for this AI MVP once you are convinced about the feasibility. PRDs aren't dead, they are thinking tools for PMs and Founders. Don't listen to anyone who tells you otherwise. List down key risks in this PRD, and how the MVP will help you test those risks. This step is important to ensure you don't have blindspots. And now you are ready to do the 3rd step well. 

3. Create a business plan for the next 2-3 years. This plan would take the API costs, training data, scale, and development + maintenance costs into account. Many a times, you will surprised at how expensive the APIs and data are as compared to your current costs. Make sure you look at gross margins scenarios (adoption based) well, before shipping it to consumers.

The frog will adjust to each temperature increase until it reaches a point where it can no longer adapt. By then, it's too late to jump out. It's a good metaphor for a lot of situations. I find it relevant for discussions around mid-tier jobs that are going to be impacted by AI.

So why mid-tier? One might ask. 

While everyone is having a general debate around AI replacing jobs, we're missing the nuance around levels which are really at risk. To see that, we can classify every job role in three tiers: fresh graduates, mid-tier, and leadership roles. 

We can see the impact AI already has on fresh graduates hiring. As reported by multiple media sites, CS grads unemployment is at all time high. These graduates are at the early stage of their career, and while the situation is painful, they can see the writing on the wall, and will do something around it in next 1-2 years. My sense is they will become AI-native in next 1-2 years, and start using AI for highest leverage. That will get them back on the track.

Senior professionals with good judgment can delegate to AI effectively. They can act as editors who don't do the main work, but use their judgement to make the output better. They have already been doing it for humans' output for some time. 

But workers with 2-6 years experience? They're the frog in the boiling water. They aren't going to be impacted quickly because they are already in jobs. But here's why they're most vulnerable: they're not senior enough for the complex strategic roles that AI can't handle, yet not junior enough to start fresh. Most importantly, the urgency they feel most around is doing well at current form of jobs, not becoming AI native. The tasks they excel at - analysis, basic coding, content creation, data processing, project management - are exactly what AI does well. 

As to why most can't sense the shift yet, one of my favourite quotes explains that - ""the future is already here. It's just unevenly distributed.""

One month into fatherhood, I realised how challenging it is to find evidence-based, affordable, and culturally relevant early learning resources in India. Most parents rely on unverified WhatsApp advice or expensive Western-centric platforms, neither of which meets our needs.

The Problem:
85% of Indian parents lack access to structured early childhood guidance
Existing solutions often assume high budgets or non-Indian contexts (e.g., expensive toy kits).
There’s no clear, age-appropriate pathway using everyday household items.


Solution: Tiny Quest

I built a platform that turns kitchen utensils, old newspapers, and other household items into fun, neuroscience-backed learning activities—without costly materials.

✅ Structured learning paths for 0-6 years
✅ Culturally adapted for Indian homes
✅ Zero-cost core content, accessible to all

This wasn’t the plan.
But something changed after I watched a 2-hour video by Deepak Singh, where he walked through AI agents, n8n, RAG, and workflow design like he was narrating the future.

It wasn’t just informative. It was the kind of content that quietly shifts something inside you. So thank you, Deepak Singh for making it public.

For showing what’s possible.
For reminding me that the best kind of learning… still happens when no one’s watching.

I kept thinking:

How do we design for a world where users aren't the ones clicking every button? Where agents talk to apps, not just people? Where “product” becomes less about interfaces, more about intelligent flow?

I don’t fully know.

But I’ve made myself a promise:

This week, I’ll try building my first basic agent using n8n. And for the next 100 days, I’ll show up here sharing one product insight, one reflection, or one experiment at a time. I will be honest, I was unsuccessful to make an agent what I had envisioned. I did try something and got my hands on dirty. I will approach again with some fresh energy.

This is #Day1 of my #100DaysOfProduct journey.

 
But maybe it’s also Day 1 of thinking differently.

 I want to start small.

Here is the link: https://lnkd.in/gGzvdRqG to the video

Some of my learnings:

AI Agents Are Not Chatbots: Most people confuse agents with just conversational bots. But agents go beyond conversation they can take autonomous actions, trigger workflows, and perform multi-step tasks without direct user input.

n8n + LangChain = No-Code Magic with Depth: Seeing how n8n integrates with APIs, LLMs, and external databases showed me how powerful low-code tools can be especially when paired with frameworks like LangChain for chaining logic and responses.

The Role of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): RAG isn’t just technical jargon. It’s how AI systems pull relevant context from external sources (like PDFs, Notion, or internal docs) before responding which radically improves the quality of outputs and user trust.

Future Products Will Be Built on Invisible Interfaces: The most powerful UX might soon be no interface at all.

I’m not a developer. I’m not even a Tech PM; I’m however someone who is #curious and wants first hand experiences. I stumbled across the concept of #vibecoding while doing a course by Deepak Singh in his AI Assisted Prototyping Program. 
I conducted experiments using vibe coding tools like Cursor, Replit and V0 by Vercel building a Personal Diet Tracker App with vibe coding, The experience was eye-opening..
Pros: 
·      Productivity boost is substantial. I could make an (almost fully) functioning app in about 7-8 hours
·      I could focus on high level problems and creative direction, and it (mostly) worked.
·      Make software development, quick prototyping and testing new ideas accessible to people without programming backgrounds
In contrast, I discovered significant challenges when projects grew more complex. 
Cons
·      AI-generated code becomes difficult to modify as complexity increases
·      Code sometimes lacks structured architecture that human programmers implement
·      Correcting inefficiencies and debugging are tough. I significantly spent 20 hours here and will need assistance.

My takeaway? Vibe coding won’t replace developers, but it’s transforming how we create software. The future is a blend: AI for speed, humans for architecture stability, creativity and security.
Curious? Try it out!

We concluded the learning sessions of the 1st live cohort of Advanced Tech and AI course last Sunday. The NPS of the cohort is at +70, considered excellent in education.

But that’s not the headline. Around 90% of cohort started building AI products as part of the capstone, and >50% of them are going to put it in production in coming weeks. The rest will get another chance at finishing their capstone in the next cohort. This is what I, as an instructor, most proud of :)

So I am excited to announce the next cohort that starts 28th June.

Here are some key things you get to do in the program:

1. AI Prototyping: Build full-stack products using AI tools such as lovable, bolt, etc.
2. Use-Case: Figure out AI use-cases in your organisation
3. Technology: Learn all aspects of AI/ ML — traditional and generative
4. Foundational Models: Understand attention and how transformers work, their limitations, etc.
5. Resources: Where to use RAG, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, reasoning, and inference optimisation. See how to do it on platforms such as OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, etc.
6. Agentic AI: Where and how to build agents and deploy them using tools such as Langgraph, n8n, etc.
7. MVP: Design and develop MVP in AI
8. Evals: The most important bit for PMs, learn how to evaluate and improve AI products to make them production-ready for your company

The outcome of this program is every learner builds a production-grade AI product within 6 months of program completion (most in 12-weeks), or moves into a AI PM role. While we are still in early days, few folks have already gotten AI PM roles through interviews, and many are building AI products within their companies. We will keep sharing stats and demo videos in coming months as proof of work. 

Consider it seriously and apply if you want to be an AI PM, or are already building an AI product. The community discussions are amazing, since we only take PMs, and not aspiring PMs/ business folks in this program.

Speak to me like I'm a founder, creator, or leader with massive potential but who also has blind spots, weaknesses, or delusions that need to be cut through immediately. I don't want comfort. I don't want fluff. I want truth that stings, if that's what it takes to grow. 

Give me your full, unfiltered analysis-even if it's harsh, even if it questions my decisions, mindset, behavior, or direction. Look at my situation with complete objectivity and strategic depth. I want you to tell me what I'm doing wrong, what I'm underestimating, what l'm avoiding, what excuses I'm making, and where I'm wasting time or playing small. Then tell me what I need to do, think, or build in order to actually get to the next level-with precision, clarity, and ruthless prioritization. If I'm lost, call it out. If I'm making a mistake, explain why. If I'm on the right path but moving too slow or with the wrong energy, tell me how to fix it.

Hold nothing back. Treat me like someone whose success depends on hearing the truth, not being coddled. End on an encouraging note.""

Apart from asking about memory or storage, everything else felt like a mystery. RAM, processor, SSD, HDD — it was a blur of jargon. I didn’t know how it all came together.

Years later, graduating in Computer Science made me fluent in those terminologies. I could throw around terms confidently — servers, APIs, backend, system architecture. But deep down, I often wondered…

Did I really understand tech? Or was I just familiar with the terms? 🤔

Recently, I stumbled upon Tech Simplified by Deepak Singh and it felt like someone distilled my entire degree into 200 pages of clarity. It’s written in a way that even someone with zero tech background can grasp the fundamentals. 

So, here are 10 key insights from the book that stuck with me;

1. Computers don’t “understand” images or text. They process everything as binary — strings of 0s and 1s. Your Spotify playlist, Gmail, even this post — it’s all converted to digital bits.

2. Software is the real driver. Without it , computers are just dumb machines. Software gives instructions and tells hardware what to do — from opening a browser to playing a YouTube video. It’s like your mind guiding your hands.

3. Internet is a physical infrastructure of wires, routers, and servers. When you send a message or stream a movie, your data travels in small packets across continents — like a postal system on steroids.

4. Websites rely on frontend (what you see), backend (logic and storage), and databases (where data lives). A simple login form connects all three in real-time.

5. More Dev Concepts – APIs Are the Middlemen
Ever ordered food via an app? That request went through an API — like a waiter taking your order to the kitchen. APIs help different systems talk to each other without chaos.

6. Mobile Apps – Whether you’re an Android or iOS, mobile apps follow the same logic: input → process → output. But the coding language and frameworks used differ. It’s like writing a novel in Hindi vs English.

7. DevOps – Making Launches Less Scary
DevOps ensures that code goes from developer laptops to real users smoothly. It automates testing, deployment, and monitoring so teams can ship fast without breaking things.

8. System design is like designing a city. You need roads (data flow), traffic lights (load balancers), hospitals (failovers), and everything must work without a crash, even with millions of users.

9. Architecture of popular apps - Ever wondered how Netflix doesn’t crash during peak hours? It’s built with microservices — small independent components that handle different tasks.

10. Working with tech – speak the same language. You don’t need to become an engineer. But knowing the basics helps you empathize and ask the right questions especially as a designer or product leader.

This book helped me to reconnect and relearn lot many things in a simple manner.

It's a humorous, nonetheless accurate take. Bugs/ troubleshooting takes most of the developer's time. So % of code written isn't proportional to % of productivity gains.

I hope founders, especially early-stage, understand this and don't make short-term calls to hurt their companies. 

In a world where writing code becomes a commodity, you still have to find the scarce resource to use it as a competitive advantage. It could be quality software or more features. But it's not going to be optimising costs.",214,11,5,5mo,Post,Deepak Singh,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak1907,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak1907/,2025-05-25T15:31:00.000Z,,2025-04-25T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-05-25

If you feel energised and excited to take action after you have chatted with this mentor, you have found a terrific one. If you feel down after the conversation (however short it was), stay away from such people in future.

Based on my experience, not all mentorship advice makes a difference. Know that there is no secret sauce that a mentor can give you. But the mentors who eventually make a difference will do so by helping you at difficult times in your life. They will do so engaging with you long-term because they love seeing someone excel due to their inputs. 

If you are looking hard enough, you will have some bad luck but you will find a good mentor along the way. Such people rarely judge you. They can be blunt but it will not feel like a bad thing because there is care and goodwill involved. It's the same thing as a close friend being blunt with you. They will be able to show potential/skills that you didn't even realise you had. 

The most common trap to avoid is looking at someone's credentials, and taking those credentials as a proxy for good mentor. We need to understand that best performers, whether in sports or life, aren't best captains/ coaches. So don't make this mistake of adhering to someone's mentorship just because they have done exceptional in their career. 

Finally, pick someone who has been where you want to go. Don't pick executive coaches who haven't been in executive roles. Don't seek advice on startups from a mature company PM. The list goes on.

Here is to finding a good mentor and the blessing they are 🥂",128,8,2,6mo,Post,Deepak Singh,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak1907,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak1907/,2025-04-25T15:31:00.000Z,,2025-04-22T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-04-25
