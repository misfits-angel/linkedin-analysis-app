While you're configuring cloud (AWS, gcp..) someone just shipped your idea.
Harsh? Maybe. True? Definitely.
what kills most side projects and early-stage ideas? It's not the coding. It's the infrastructure maze.
Setting up databases, configuring deployments, managing security, backup systems... You're solving DevOps problems before you've validated if anyone even wants what you're building.
I've watched brilliant developers spend 3 weeks setting up their stack before writing a single line of product code. That's not building—that's just paying the ""getting started"" tax.
The worst part? You do it all over again for the next idea.
We built TableSprint to break this pattern. Native database, security handled, deployments sorted. Not because it's convenient—because your time should go into the thing that matters: solving the actual problem. Keep vibe coding. AI has made things way faster and simpler....

For why this is recommended practice for hiring process, read below. Happy to help anyone to set this up.

https://lnkd.in/gbzfJqwN

Many hiring posts, including those from very big companies, publicly display personal and professional emails asking candidates to send their resumes. Is it a best practice for candidates to share the resumes on individual email accounts? There can be many downsides to this:

1. High chance of spamming the hiring manager
2. Overload of emails impacting the regular emails
3. Risk of losing the resumes with the email
4. Piling up of all documents with one individual
5. Acknowledging all the candidates becomes almost impossible 

What about having one excel like database where candidates can share their resumes so that teams can coordinate the interview process and also use them for future communication? Following can be its core benefits:

1. Central repository without manually transferring candidate resumes and documents
2. Automatic acknowledgement of candidate submissions and also decisions of the interview process
3. Avoiding losing resumes due to individual actions and movement in and out of the organization
4. Manage the overall hiring process in a coordinated manner with multiple reviewers

Additional Benefits:

1. Get automated summary such as number of resumes submitted every day
2. Provide filters to screen resumes that meet specific criteria

This is my litmus test for tech solutions and engineering reviews. This applies to most businesses, if not all.

Any non-tech person can easily do this check of their database. It has a nice Excel-like UI through phpMyAdmin, Workbench, pgAdmin, or SQL Developer. You can have it on your laptop or ask your team for read-only access.

Most use cases will involve single-digit tables...
If you discover that you need hundreds of tables to scale, that's a red flag.

The impact of reducing tables is huge for scale and agility:
Cloud costs will go down
Development costs will go down
Scaling will be easier
Team movement and maintenance will be 10x easier

A simple hack of requiring CEO or founder approval for each new table will do wonders for your tech output.

WordPress has 12 core tables covering admin, webpages, SEO...

Now you need to roll it out to 5,000. What could go wrong?

Building for a small team and for enterprise are two different things.
The moment you scale beyond your core team, user and data permissions become your biggest bottleneck. I've seen promising solutions crash and burn during enterprise rollouts—not because of performance issues, but because of permission complexity.

Here's the reality: Even the best RBAC systems and software don't perform well here and can't fulfill all types of users and permissions. Most of the time, we keep struggling to assign roles to users, and the same user needs three roles but only partial permissions from each role.

At TableSprint, we have built the first of its kind and the most granular permission system, which starts from table fields and goes up to the micro-app level!

Field-level precision: You can attach one user to one field of one worksheet with edit/view/delete permissions.

Role-based orchestration: You can put all users, emails, roles, and departments in one sheet and use it to orchestrate all permissions across all available datasets.

Multi-tenant flexibility: For micro-apps and view-level access, you can choose domain-wise permissions (your domain, partners, or vendors) with a few emails included, excluded, or both.

Universal configurability: However one wants, they can configure permissions for datasets and UIs.

The whole permission architecture is built with first principles and a second-to-none configuration style.

The result? Rolling out apps to thousands of users is just like sharing a link on WhatsApp.

Creating dashboards has been one of the most common but most dragging projects that I have been involved in. Many times, it becomes difficult to arrive at a consensus on what metrics to show, prioritize them in given space. In most cases, what users want to see and analyze does not fit in the small space. 

At TableSprint, anyone can vibe code dashboards and then chat with them to view and analyze the data. Sharing the video demo of one such micro app for a BFSI application. By the way, we can easily clone this application and share it with anyone who wants to build such dashboards and chat feature.

Watch Video

Using TableSprint's VibeCoding feature, I created an automated system that handles the entire lead qualification process without any coding knowledge required.

Phantombuster - one of the most used tool linkedin prospecting- they have free plan
openai - you can use any other llm as well

Here's what it does:

1. Scrapes LinkedIn profiles through PhantomBuster integration
2. Extracts profile data: name, company, followers, skills, job title, connections, location
Pulls email addresses automatically
3. Uses OpenAI to score each lead based on profile fit
4. Composes personalized outreach emails
5. Only sends emails to leads above your defined threshold score
6. It mimics human and agents from phantombuster takes care of limits and do drip campaign

The entire workflow runs through a single MicroApp. You just need to plug in your PhantomBuster API, OpenAI key, and set your targeting criteria. Then it runs completely hands-free.

What's interesting is how this replaces expensive prospecting tools that charge thousand dollars. 
The same functionality, built in a weekend, using WorkAgent by TableSprint.

The scoring system analyzes company size, role relevance, and engagement patterns to determine lead quality before crafting personalized messages.

If you're curious about the setup, feel free to DM me. Happy to share the agent clone.

Four pillars of our platform -small video 

1. MicroApps through Chat - We've designed something pretty cool - just tell our AI what you want and it builds your app! No more dragging boxes around or learning complex tools. Want a kanban board for your sales team? Just ask. Need a calendar view for projects? Say the word. It honestly feels like magic sometimes.

2. Worksheets for Data & Views - We've built this smart data layer that's like Excel on steroids. Parent-child relationships, unlimited views, crazy formulas - all the nerdy stuff that makes data actually useful. Our users can structure data once and slice it a million different ways.

3. WorkAgents for Flows & LLMs - This one took a lot of effort and brainpower! We've created AgentSprint - think workflows that actually understand context. LLM calls, embeddings, RAG, web scraping - it's like having a really smart intern that never sleeps and can talk to any API.

4. Chatbots for Discovery - My personal favorite - users can build chatbots that know their business inside out. ""Find me all red widgets under $50"" or ""Show me last quarter's reports"" - it just works with their actual data through embeddings.

Building tools that actually make complex things simple is harder than it looks. Still tweaking this every day - will come up with new updates and features of TableSprint.

I've been subscribed to newsletters from several AI App builder platforms. Something caught my attention recently.
One of these platforms—which promises rapid app development—sends submission requests for user-created apps through Google Forms. They've recently upgraded to Typeform. 

It got me thinking about forms as a fundamental building block. For most applications beyond simple landing pages, you need robust form functionality: user registration, data collection, feedback systems, contact forms.

There's something telling about the tools a company chooses for their own operations.
When evaluating any development platform, one needs to pay attention not just to marketing demos, but to what they actually use to run their own business.

P.S. - If any of these platforms are reading this, might I suggest trying TableSprint forms? You can build one through chat and it won't cost a fortune... just saying! :)

Sometimes the most honest product review is hidden in plain sight.

It's not the code. It's the friction.

Here's what the data actually shows:
Developers spend less than 32% of their time writing new code. The rest? Fighting infrastructure, waiting for approvals, and debugging environments.

This is the silent killer of every company:

❌ 23% of developer time wasted on legacy system maintenance
❌ 64% of developers spend 90+ minutes daily just searching for solutions
❌ 10-20% of new product budgets diverted to fixing broken infrastructure
❌ 5-15 hours per developer per week lost to unproductive work

Meanwhile, your competitors are shipping features while you're still in sprint planning.

The game has changed.
Companies that figure out how to eliminate this friction will dominate the next decade.
Imagine if building enterprise applications was as easy as having a conversation.

No more:

Wrestling with 15 different deployment tools
Waiting 3 days for DevOps approval
Losing momentum in endless technical meetings
Brilliant ideas dying in development hell

The future belongs to teams that can think at the speed of conversation and build at the speed of thought.

Your best developers shouldn't be infrastructure experts. They should be problem solvers.

From a marketing point of view, that’s smart — it hooks the user.

But the real work begins where most platforms stop — infra, security, scale, reliability. That’s the hard, unglamorous part. And honestly, most vibe coding tools avoid it — because it takes years of work, real-world pain, and deep experience to get it right.

At TableSprint, we’ve done that groundwork.We didn’t just build a flashy front-end tool. We built the infra, added enterprise-grade security, and designed it to handle real-world use cases — not just prototypes.

If you’re building for production, and want something that goes beyond landing pages and UI mockups, TableSprint’s vibe coding approach can take you there.

I haven’t come across many platforms that bring together infra, security, AI, and flexibility the way we’ve tried to do.

I strongly suggest stop wasting time on landing page builders disguised as development work. It's better to spend that time on tools like TableSprint, where you'll actually build something real — something people can truly use.

We even tried to force-fit it into some scenarios—but honestly, the combination of LLMs and engineering has been more than enough. If you’re not using MCP, that seems perfectly fine and you are not missing anything. Most use cases don’t really need it.

While our focus is on enterprise-grade capabilities, we’re also seeing how well our products work for individuals and small teams. We’ll keep an eye on how we bring MCP in our stack..

While OpenAI’s $3B acquisition of Windsurf signals how serious this change is globally and we believe that India is not far behind.

TableSprint is reducing dependency on senior engineers and empowering teams to build internal tools and apps with speed and clarity.

What excites us is that this is structured, scalable and aligned with how modern teams actually work.

As AI tools improve the dev space, we’re betting on those that make collaboration, iteration and execution dramatically easier.

What was once the domain of seasoned developers writing thousands of lines of code is now being reimagined by AI agents that respond to plain English—and even images. Coding is evolving into a more intuitive, artistic, and radically faster process.

In this insightful story for The businessline, Sanjana B speaks to Nagasanthosh Josyula Co-founder of TableSprint, a full-stack, chat-based AI app builder. Enterprises like Flipkart, Vedantu, Elever and Easebuzz are already using Tablesprint to build complex, scalable tools—without writing a single line of code.

Their platform, DevConsult AI, pioneers ""vibe coding""—where users describe their idea and the app builds itself, competing with global players like Replit and Lovable. 
💬 “The barrier to building tech has dropped dramatically,” Joysula says. “Anyone with an idea can prototype and test it—without formal CS training.”
Experts like Jaspreet Bindra, AI&Beyond and Mayank Maggon of TechChefz Digital agree: AI won't replace engineers—but will elevate their roles to focus on strategy, debugging, and refinement.

A new era of software creation is here—and it’s powered by conversation.

To those who are new to this technique like me, frogs are the tasks that we have high tendency to procrastinate or they may be most difficult tasks. 

So, I built a small tool that orders the given tasks according to their difficulty level. The most helpful feature is that the difficult levels are auto assigned by AI.
