A new trend is quietly redefining the Indian wedding scene.
Brides are sending their wedding invites to brands, and the brands are sending back gifts.

Welcome to the PR Wedding, where emotion meets marketing and love meets luxury. 💫

From Plum, The Body Shop India, and Dot & Key to Forest Essentials, Sula Vineyards, and mCaffeine, Indian brands are embracing this heartfelt marketing shift. Some even curate full-size hampers for couples who send them wedding invites.

So why are brands doing this?
Because weddings are now content ecosystems. Every unboxing, every “getting-ready” story, and every thank-you tag becomes authentic reach, the kind of organic brand love money can’t buy.

💡 How to Apply:
 Most brands accept invites via their PR or community email IDs or through Instagram DMs. A warm, personalized message with your digital wedding invite or card works best. Include your wedding dates, theme, and location, and always tag their official handles once you receive your PR box.
This isn’t about freebies. It’s about connection. When a bride invites a brand, she’s saying, “Be part of my story.” And the brands are listening. 💍

💬 If your brand received a wedding invite tomorrow, would you send a PR box or a blessing?

The day after the wedding rarely feels like happily-ever-after. It looks more like heaps of waste.

It’s the part of weddings no one puts on Instagram, wilted flowers dumped into landfills, leftover food scraped into bins, and décor dismantled in haste. The Indian wedding industry produces over 1 million tonnes of food waste annually, and floral décor alone contributes to 15–20% of event waste streams.

We’ve perfected the idea of “eco-friendly weddings” in décor sourcing, sustainable outfits, and digital invites. Yet the blind spot remains: what happens after the music stops.

✨ Here’s how the industry can turn the tide:

➡️ Repurpose flowers: Tie-ups with companies that recycle blooms into incense, organic colors, dyeing of sarees, or compost.

➡️ Food redistribution: Partner with NGOs like Robin Hood Army or Feeding India to channel surplus food to communities in need.

➡️ Circular décor: Modular installations that can be rented, reused, and reimagined across multiple events.

➡️ Waste audits: Professional tracking of post-event waste to create accountability and improve practices.

Sustainability in weddings goes beyond the vows; it’s in what you leave behind. 
Because luxury isn’t just in how weddings look, it’s in how responsibly they leave their mark.

And at the heart of this revolution? The bridal lehenga.

Once a symbol of permanence, a family heirloom folded into trunks of silk and memory, bridal couture is now being rewritten. Millennials and Gen Z brides are choosing access over ownership, glamour without guilt, couture without compromise. Renting a Sabyasachi, Falguni Shane Peacock, or Manish Malhotra lehenga is no longer taboo; it’s the new frontier of luxury.

✨ Here’s what this shift means for the wedding fashion industry:

➡️ Democratization of couture: Brides in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities now walk down the aisle in global couture once limited to elite circles.

➡️ New business models: Designers are pivoting to “bridal-as-a-service”, rentals, resale platforms, and modular designs extending a garment’s lifecycle.

➡️ Cultural evolution: Heirlooms are still sacred, but modern brides balance legacy with pragmatism, pairing a grandmother’s Banarasi with a rented couture lehenga.

➡️ Sustainability as luxury: With fashion contributing 10% of global carbon emissions (United Nations Environmental Programme), rentals align indulgence with responsibility. Eco-consciousness has become the new definition of elegance.

At Spreeh, we see this not as a trend but a renaissance. Because the future of bridal couture isn’t about what you own, it’s about how you experience, repurpose, and reimagine luxury.

📊 In 2024, 26% of weddings in India were destination-based, up from 18% just two years ago.
That number will only rise 🔺

Destination weddings are no longer a niche.
They’re the default for the next generation.

💵 Families spend ₹50L to ₹5Cr on a single wedding — sometimes 20-25% of their lifetime savings — without a single system to manage the madness.

Despite the scale, weddings are still planned like college group projects:
📍 Guest lists in Excel
📍 Rooming in Google Sheets
📍 Itineraries in PDFs
📍 Communication across 8-15 different WhatsApp groups

When I first joined Spreeh as a trainee and intern 10 months ago, I walked in slightly unsure, a little under-confident but full of curiosity and excitement. Today, I leave with a stronger voice, sharper skills, and the kind of confidence that only comes from learning by doing.

From writing blogs and creating content to curating reels every project was an opportunity to grow, challenge myself, and rediscover my creative spark. 

One moment I’ll never forget? The Band Baaja Blunder shoot over 60 videos in just two days. It was chaotic, energizing, and hands down one of the most creatively fulfilling experiences I’ve had.

Another highlight was witnessing Spreeh’s Instagram journey going from 50K to 100K followers and being in the middle of all the planning, posting, and passion that helped it grow.

A heartfelt thank you to Siddharth Chaturvedi for fostering a culture that celebrates fresh ideas, initiative, and originality. Your trust gave me the space to experiment and evolve.

To my mentors, Krina Mehta and Nandini Patel thank you for your constant guidance, clarity, and belief in my potential. You’ve deeply shaped the way I approach marketing and storytelling today.

And to my incredible teammates Keertana Nair Preeyana Vira Harini Brahmbhatt Bhuveer Kodnani Suramya Srivastava Niti Shah thank you for all the collaboration, laughter, and support. You made every day memorable.

As I step into new opportunities, I carry with me everything this chapter has taught me professionally and personally. I’m leaving with more confidence, experience, and a whole lot of gratitude.

It’s not luck. It’s structure.

After reaching over 20M+ people organically every month, we’ve learned what actually works and built a repeatable system around it.

Here’s how we approach content that gets saved, shared, and rewatched:

Cultural Trigger
We start with something the audience already feels- like “Which bridal look is your vibe?” or “Colour combos for couples.” It’s familiar, emotional, and immediately relevant.
 
Trending Format
Whether it's 4-image decor moodboards or Reels structured like quick how-tos, we use formats the audience already loves.

Storytelling
We turn beautiful shots into relatable narratives- “Must-have wedding poses ” or “Bookmark these portraits.” It’s content that moves people to act.

Everything is organic. No boosting. Just timing, structure, and knowing what makes people pause.

If you're a brand or agency looking to tap into wedding content that actually performs, we’d love to collaborate.

Let's Look at the Facts! 📊

The Indian wedding industry is massive - valued at ₹1,00,000+ crores! From glamorous venues to designer outfits, these celebrations are larger than life. But in 2024, are they really worth it? Let's break it down!

The Good Side 🎉
• Culture & Tradition: These weddings keep our heritage alive! 78% of Indian families say wedding rituals help pass cultural values to the next generation. The music, dance, and ceremonies create an unforgettable cultural experience.

• Family Bonds: Over 50% of couples report stronger family ties post-wedding. With the average Indian wedding hosting 750 guests, it's the perfect reunion spot!

The Reality Check 💭
• Planning Pressure: 60% of couples face major stress during planning. Managing vendors, venues, and guest lists for 3-5 day celebrations isn't easy!

• Lost Moments: With 1000+ guests (the average for upper-middle-class weddings), 72% of couples regret not spending enough time with close family.

The Verdict? 🤔
While these weddings come with challenges, their cultural value is priceless. A 2023 @WeddingWire survey found that 85% of Indian families still prefer traditional big celebrations over intimate ones!

Regardless Spreeh is here to bring your wedding dreams to life. 
Big or intimate, we ensure your big day is planned with expertise and most importantly love 💜

I joined Spreeh as the Social Media Head 6 months ago, and at that time I was filled with self-doubt and would question my abilities every day. Those first 3 months? I’ll admit, I felt the urge to quit more times than I can count. But instead, I chose to trust the process and simply keep working. Somewhere in that challenge, I began to find purpose and build resilience.

Most importantly the patience and support of Siddharth Chaturvedi, our founder at Spreeh, gave me the time and space I needed to grow. The growth I’m experiencing by working at a start-up is astronomical and would 100% recommend it to anyone my age:

Professionally:
✏️Crafting social media and Ad campaign strategies (with 100% creative freedom!)
🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒Gaining firsthand insight into consumer and audience behavior 
🔎Maximising + repurposing resources and assets effectively (and economically!)

Personally:
📈Discipline & consistency by adapting a growth mindset
🔗The value of teamwork and synergy 

My biggest takeaway:
At some point in life, early or later, we all have to put in the hard-work. When we recognize our potential and cultivate the willpower to tap into it, growth becomes inevitable. 

PS: We’re expanding our team! We're looking for a Client Servicing Executive and a Chief Technology Officer. If this journey resonates with you and you’re looking for a fast paced environment that helps you grow similarly, send in your CVs and reach out to us at: Bhuveer.kodnani@spreeh.com

As we wrap up our residency with a fund, it turns out that being a solo founder isn’t quite the golden ticket for early-stage investors. Who knew? But hey, I’m grateful for the amazing team that helped us refine our vision & being patient with us, even if we didn’t get the funding this time around.

What do we have going for us? Well, we’ve been in the wedding biz for over 9 years and our platform in just 5 months of being live has racked up over 2000 leads worth 50cr+ , closed 22 of those, and have 10 more in the pipeline. Plus, we’ve got solid partnerships with top vendors who are all on board or in the process which would cover the entire supply chain network. 

The catch? We need a tech wizard (a.k.a. a CTO) to help us revolutionize the wedding world. If you’re young, a little tech-savvy, and ready to build a consumer platform that changes the game (while having a blast), we want to hear from you!

CTO Position Available (Cash + Equity)

If you’re looking for a chance to make an impact in a fun industry, this is it!
Know someone who fits the bill? 
Send their CVs to siddharth.chaturvedi@spreeh.com.
As a thank you, anyone who helps us find our tech hero will earn a month’s salary of the new hire. 

And don’t worry—thanks to our fantastic angels backing us, we’re ready to push forward and truly transform the wedding industry.
