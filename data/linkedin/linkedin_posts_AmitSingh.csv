LLMs made us believe one big model could do it all.. that felt like boiling the ocean. It worked for some cases, but not for all... especially not for agents.

Agents need fast, cheap, narrow intelligence.. not general reasoning every time. Most agent tasks are structured, repetitive, mechanical... parsing inputs, calling APIs, generating boilerplate. You don’t need a 175b model for that... but most agents still call one.

SLMs flip the architecture.. instead of hitting a central brain, you embed small, specialized models into the workflow.

One model per task. Cheap, fast, easy to align, better latency, better unit economics, and often better performance.

Pitching is not about polished slides. Or smooth articulation. It is about answering a few questions well. 

What is your proposition? 
Why should you win?
What can you become?

Personally, I have struggled the most with ‘what is my proposition’. It is a simple question but is the most difficult to answer. Unless it is not, like for startups who are building Uber for India or Blinkit for meds. But if you are trying to do something tangential, this one is the hardest.

When we get stuck like this, it’s not a bad idea to remember Charlie Munger’s “Invert, always invert.” Some ambiguity gets addressed by answering ‘what we are not’.

AI unleashes way more code into the world. More lines written means more potential failure points. More lines means more surface area for bugs. 

Also, the volume increase isn't linear. Bug density per line often climbs when developers lean on AI. Because they understand less of what they ship.

Human-written code fails in familiar ways. Off by one errors. Null pointer exceptions. Memory leaks in predictable spots. 

AI bugs are different animals… they emerge from training data quirks or model hallucinations. It creates perfectly syntactic code that does something subtly wrong. Traditional QA tools scan for known anti patterns. 

This creates a market wedge for an AI native startup… legacy testing tools are not designed for probabilistic code generation. New tools focus on how AI fails and try to the ‘weird’ stuff that developers using Cursor struggle with. 

The amateur coder explosion complicates this.. non technical people building with AI may need different QA. Because they can't debug traditional errors… and thus need plain English explanations and automated fixes. Could this be its own market segment.

To put it all together, more ‘developers’ writing a lot more code, code that has more bugs, and probably different type of bugs. Seems like a setup for a massive opportunity for a Cursor for QA kind of product.

But.. what if the code generators just absorb the QA function? Amazon's Kiro is already trying to build testing into the generation process… if Cursor and others follow this path, would standalone QA tools become less relevant. 

But then will there will be any bugs in the future? Even perfect code generators can produce imperfect results when they interact with messy prompts and missing context. Maybe the bugs don't disappear, they just shift form. Maybe ‘developers’ will push boundaries when code becomes bug-free… and new bug types will emerge.. and the cat and mouse game will continue.

At the moment I'm leaning towards 'Cursor will own the QA problem' because non-bugs is their problem statement too. But there must be a founder somewhere who find a way... What's your take?

Quick commerce is a single-run logistics model. No milk runs. No batch deliveries. No fat AOVs to cushion costs. Every order must carry its own weight. And that weight gets heavier as you leave the metros. Lower density. Longer distances. Smaller baskets. Less willingness to pay for speed.

The result? Non-metros have underperformed, as Sajith points out.
“In the Indus Valley Report we had expressed scepticism where quick commerce could be profitable beyond the top 5% of pincodes in India (which had both density and affluence). This seems to have been broadly on the ball.”
Sajith Pai, VC, Blume Ventures
Source: Twitter / X

And yet, Flipkart Minutes is doubling down.
“The next wave of growth in quick commerce will come from 'non-California customers' who are more value-centric. This is where the majority of India's retail market lies, and we see a mix of both premium and value-centric users coming into play.”
Kanchan Mishra, Head, Flipkart Minutes 
Source: Outlook Business

My uneducated view is this. The real question isn’t whether quick commerce should go beyond metros. It’s how. Maybe the answer isn’t 10-minute delivery in Tier 2. Maybe it’s two hours. Or six. Maybe the winning category isn’t ice cream. Maybe it’s fashion. Or electronics. The problem is not demand. Tier 2 has plenty. But it has a different rhythm. Different frictions. Availability. Product access. Someone has to decode that.

In 2012, when I was at Jabong, we were pushed to launch same-day delivery. I tried to agrue against it. It was expensive, our contribution margins were already hurting us. And I thought the customer didn’t care. But.. the relevant team launched same-day delivery in Gurgaon and next-day in Bangalore. And it worked. Customers loved it. They shifted. That’s when I learned: 

It's not about whether the customer wants it. It’s about whether the customer will switch if someone offers it. All else being equal. And that is not metro user behavior. That is human behavior.

Even the slowest quick commerce beats the fastest ecommerce.
Half of ecommerce orders come from tier 2. In these cities getting your order in 6 hours instead of 3 days is a massive upgrade. Quick commerce doesn’t need to match metro speed. It just needs to materially beat what exists. 

So maybe quick commerce in tier 2 will focus on different categories, and offer lesser SLAs.

But good angels don’t spray... they are deliberate. but they take more bets. not because they lack conviction, but because early-stage is uncertain.

I’ve seen a few angels with enviable portfolios who later launched funds.. their funds did well. but not as well as their angel picks. 

Personally, I like to back founders who i know can build if they are focused on a fertile space.

Give me a team of the best quantum engineers. people who are constructive and dedicated and can do transformational work. and i will absolutely disappoint you. i will not know what to do with them. or how to channel their expertise into something meaningful.

But in a way, that's what we are all doing. we have round-the-clock access to analysts waiting to take our instructions. but we're trapped in jobs that keep us busy with narrow tasks, micro-optimizations, and ‘people management’.

IMO, it's time to pivot. as agents become more capable, these skills will matter less. today we celebrate the more productive ones among us. tomorrow we will not. because agents are inherently efficient, humans can’t beat them in the efficiency game. just like (even) usain bolt can’t beat chevy bolt. in a narrow task, his favorite 200 meter dash. 

In fact, those focused on narrow tasks will suffer twice. first they will miss out on this big opportunity, and then lose what they have to the agents. value will be captured by those who can take a step back, see the big picture, look at agents as capabilities, as lego blocks, and make something that people want with it. call them ‘architects’.

“ai can’t do my job well”, will be some famous last words. this is not the end state, models will improve. many of the tasks that we do as a part of the jobs that pay our rents exist only because a machine that can do it cheaper, better, faster has not been invented yet. but these new machines are coming for our white-collared tasks, if not jobs. so consider pivoting. be like mockingjays. build new capabilities. figure out how to combine these lego blocks, the ai capabilities, to create emergent value. work at the intersection of multiple skills. and embrace ambiguity, because the defined roles will be, you guessed it, taken up by the agents. 

Most of us can build new competencies. but a few of us will. because it's rather tempting to outsource our thinking to language models and get that instant value (write my prd or reply to my email). these immediate gains will make us believe that we are winning with ai. but it will actually keep us from building durable competencies. start thinking like ‘architects’, they will trump the optimizers. there will be rewarding jobs and there will be relentless agents. and since employees needed per project will shrink, there will be little space for people managers.

It's time to pivot. early is fine, late is fatal. the great divergence is upon us. darwin will be on steroids. market will act like nature in evolution. those who have hunger to succeed will pivot and adapt and succeed. don’t wait for the memo, the hunger games have begun.",Image,43,4,1,3mo,Post,Amit Singh,https://www.linkedin.com/in/amisingh,https://www.linkedin.com/in/amisingh/,2025-07-17T11:03:00.000Z,,2025-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-07-17

I believe the best learning is situational. It happens in the moment. Books and case studies are useful, but what matters is internalizing lessons and applying them when it counts.

This is our motivation behind building Misfits. If India has to produce more and better founders, we should create situations and let more people be exposed to the struggles of building startups.

Misfits lets you live through a startup's journey. The pitch, the operational highs and lows, the funding rounds and IPOs, and even the shutdowns. 

Seeing different companies from multiple angles helps you build a feel for what to build, how to build it, and where to compete. You develop an instinct for building. It's like how we learn to walk or speak: through immersion and iteration, not by reading a manual.

To understand users, we need to see what they do and feel their struggles.

User interviews can help, but they are tricky. Because people tend to offer solutions instead of describing their actual pain points. We have to keep nudging them back to their problems.

Another way is to 'watch' what users do in real time. A Slack bot can be configured to post messages for key actions. For instance, when a user (unidentified) adds an item to their cart, removes it, and then adds another as a replacement, you can't help but wonder what's going on. You start to feel their dilemma. That's when the real learning happens. In the moment.

You won't get this from a spreadsheet. Aggregate data is fine for tracking metrics, but it doesn't help you build intuition about the user behaviour.

The Slack channel can get noisy, and it's easy to start ignoring it. Hence, it helps to focus on one problem at a time. If you're working on improving cancellations, just follow the cancellations channel.

and lessons from Granola

Where to play? What to solve? These are the first set of decisions that we founders have to make. All other decisions like ‘How to play?’, ‘Who to hire?’ are downstream choices. We get more shots to get them right.

Startups have limited resources. So we need to start with a subset of the market. And become more ambitious over time. The ‘where to play’ thus translates into ‘how to slice’. 

Tackle a narrow problem for many customers? 
Or a broader problem for a few customers?

My preference is to go vertical. Going horizontal makes it harder to build a sticky product. Because there are too many user personas to worry about. And even if one can build a compelling product, it is not enough. As Granola is finding out. 

They built an elegant product for the universal problem of meetings. But that universality may have been their flaw. They stepped directly into the ‘kill zone’ of giants like Google, Microsoft, and, as we now realize, OpenAI. OpenAI has put Granola's business at risk overnight with a single feature update. 

Often, building a horizontal product is like being a tenant. The landlord will have the final say. 

So, where to play? 
Not in their territory. Find a small piece of land where you can be the landlord. A market that you can own.

That often means finding an underserved segment. Where horizontal products seem like a force fit. Talk to these users. Find out their pressing problems. Build to solve those problems.

Play where you can earn the right to win. And then work your way up.",Image,32,6,0,4mo,Post,Amit Singh,https://www.linkedin.com/in/amisingh,https://www.linkedin.com/in/amisingh/,2025-06-17T11:03:00.000Z,,2025-06-09T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-06-17
https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7335564651264385026,,"The future belongs to product managers. Here is (my) why.

We’ve already seen engineers become product managers. Especially in products used by developers or products requiring 'heavy' engineering. That was the old story. 

The new story is this. Product managers will become developers. It will start with PMs using tools like Creatr or Lovable to do the prototyping. That will give them the confidence to try and use products like Cursor. Over time, these products will evolve to solve issues where people are getting stuck today. Emergent is already trying that.

The kind of creativity this will unlock, the kind of products this will unleash, is going to be wild.

I’m not talking about PMs who are mere project managers. I'm talking about the real ones. The ones who deeply understand users. Those who get business. And know how engineers think. And how products are built. Those who have worked with different teams. Be it marketing, ops, or design. And even leadership and P&L owners. The ones who understand the value of iteration. The builder type PMs. 

They sit at the cross-section. They see the whole picture. They are best placed to become founders. They will build the next generation of products.

We rarely invest in pre-product startups.

Because (often) they are not startups. They are just pitch decks filled with claims. And with assumptions dished out as insights. Not because the founders are lying. But because the founders have been tricked into believing those assumptions. By themselves. 

They lack belief. To build with belief, you need to build belief. How to build belief?

Belief comes from pain.

(Saying it from experience. The pain I felt while commuting in Mumbai made me believe it's a problem worth solving. Even the features I built were born from a pain I experienced on public transport in Mumbai.)

Sometimes life brings pain.
Sometimes we inflict pain upon ourselves.

How?

Build something. Get users to try it. Realise no one cares about what you have built. That’s a moment of reckoning. Figure out why they don’t care. Shatter some of your assumptions.

Then build something different. 
Or build the same thing differently.

Again, realise that no one cares. Have another moment of reckoning. Rinse and repeat. 
After many such reckonings, most assumptions shatter. The few that hold become beliefs. You know because you’ve felt the pain of getting a handful of users to care. You’d go to the ends of the earth and beyond for them. 

It’s a belief if others don’t agree with you.
It’s an insight if others agree with you.

Don’t worry about people who tell you it’s not an insight, and that they knew it all along. 

They won’t bet years of their lives on that ‘insight’. But you would. Because they do not believe in it. But you do. Because they haven’t gone through the pain to get here. But you have. That’s your strength. That makes you a founder. That makes it a startup.

The real founders are here.

The ones who came in because 'capital was easy to come by' are gone. The ones who can build despite capital are building.

They started when pre-seed rounds were hard to come by. They felt the pain that followed the wild bull run of 2021. They learned from the mistakes of the ‘let’s buy our way to growth’ founders. 

That’s why they are making sense. They are talking numbers. They are building real businesses. They are relentlessly trying to break even. 

While they are wide awake, have they forgotten how to dream? Are they too influenced by the recent past? And not seeing what lies ahead?

Now is the time to dream. Because LLMs make it easier than ever to deliver more Aha moments sooner. (However, the founders still need to understand their users well. Because that aspect of knowing one’s users hasn’t changed.)

The pendulum almost always swings too far. 

Founders need to be real. 
But they also need to be a little delulu.
Real about costs and means maybe.

The top Youtubers of tomorrow could look very different from the top Youtubers of today. Because what got them here won’t get them there.

Why am I saying this?
You need to do 20-odd things to succeed Youtube. You need to have something to say. And be able to articulate your thoughts. And speak well. Be willing to face the camera and record. Be willing to go through the pain of video editing. Also have some kind of setup with a camera, microphone, and lighting... And more importantly, have the motivation to go through this grind, day in and day out. Because only then Youtube will reward you. 

So, to be a successful Youtuber
You need to be a Youtuber. Which is less than easy. 
And post videos consistently. Which is more than difficult.

Twist in the tale
Classical AI ‘disruption’ at play. Video editing tools (Veed.io, Descript, etc.) were evolving nicely.
Because GenAI was powering them
But GenAI is now also powering ground-up synthetic video generation

ByteDance has introduced a human animation model, OmniHuman-1, (check the video). And this is only the beginning. Soon, generating your synthetic videos should become easier than editing your recorded videos.

My guess is in the future, you would record yourself talking to the camera for say 20 minutes, and press “Produce”. And the AI would automatically clean up your transcript, make it tighter, recreate (generate) your voice (with better diction and modulation), recreate (generate) your video, tweak your gestures and expressions on-screen, and give you an appropriate background. 

And turn that 20-minutes recording
In a polished 5-minute crisp video
In 5 minutes

Which will create new constraints
Which will produce new winners
They will be famous. On Youtube. In 2026.

All this, because, generating will be easier than editing. 

Who will be the new winners?
Those who will deeply understand a subject or a topic. 
So, if you have real insights to share, if you have an interesting story to tell, you won’t be held back by production hurdles. Because when production becomes trivial, people who deeply understand a topic can publish quality stuff frequently, often, without worrying about lights, camera, or their clothes. And we will not have to endure those who lack depth but can produce videos. 

If you have something interesting or insightful to say, you will be heard.

Resources are not.

I’ve yet to come across a founder who, when given excess capital, hasn’t resorted to solving the problem by throwing money at it. Whether through aggressive distribution. Or hiring more people. Or as we are finding out deploying more H100s.

Capital is crucial to building a product and solving the user’s problem. But too much capital? That’s a curse. It often gets in the way of founders using their product to truly solve the problem at hand.

I’ve been talking about this as a broken record. But this perspective comes to me from observing the Silicon Valley founders. So it's interesting to see them pouring billions into foundational models. Trying to brute-force their way through problems with capital.

And then, one day, we wake up to an unknown Chinese team achieving similar results. At a fraction of the resources.*

Seeing this unfold is satisfying. As we back founders who win with their product. It’s a reminder that even in an era when billions get thrown like millions, there’s still room for a handful of product-focused minds solving user problems without vast sums of money.

And that’s a win. For founders who don’t have access to deep pockets. For misfits who do not buy the prevailing narrative. Even if it’s a temporary win, it signals that big ideas do not need huge resources, just resourcefulness. Resourceful founders do more with less.

It’s interesting that the fastest large models (LLMs) also happen to be the cheapest. These models are quick to respond but may not be the best problem-solvers. 

Also, the most expensive models tend to be the slowest. They take much longer to arrive at their answer, but can solve difficult problems and hence are valuable. 

This is by design. These models are forced to not respond immediately. This is to give them more time to compute. Which increases their costs. But more importantly also improves the quality of their reasoning. 

It takes time but it works.

We see this pattern among humans as well. Those who reply instantly generally haven’t thought the problem through. And vice versa. 

Difficult problems take more compute to solve, and hence often more time to solve. 
True for language models. 
True for individuals. 
True for founders.

Back to the question
How do we know? 

We keep probing the founders. Keep asking nuanced questions. Questions they have not been asked before. But give them time to think. 

The insightful founders surprise us. 
And even surprise themselves.
