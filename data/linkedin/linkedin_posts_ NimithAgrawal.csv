First of all, I’m grateful that my dedication to AyushPay sparked such meaningful dialogue—after all, conversations like these are what help us grow as individuals and professionals.

For me, my wedding day was one of the most special moments of my life, and my life partner means the world to me. Yet, as a founder, I also have responsibilities that go beyond myself—to my investors, my employees, and the vision we’ve built together at AyushPay. The timing was far from ideal, but certain decisions that day were made with the good of the business in mind.

Does that mean I don’t value my wedding? Absolutely not. It was a balancing act between two deeply important aspects of my life. My wife, who has been my biggest support, stood by me even in this unconventional moment, and for that, I’ll forever be grateful.

Work-life balance isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution—it’s a deeply personal equation. While my choices may not resonate with everyone, I hope they inspire a reflection on the sacrifices and commitments we as Founders make in pursuit of our goals.
