It’s not enough to say we can build it, so let’s build it. The real question is: 𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅 𝗲𝗻𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵, 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝘂𝘀 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗺𝘀𝗲𝗹𝘃𝗲𝘀?

That’s why in infrastructure businesses like ours, embracing complexity is not optional—it’s the moat. A fintech will only adopt a new layer from us if they believe we’ve invested the time, scale, and depth that would otherwise take them months (or years) to replicate.

Sometimes this means building ahead of demand. When we started with digital FDs, the market wasn’t loudly asking for it. But we had to forecast the need, invest deeply, and become the lead indicator—so that by the time the demand arrived, the infrastructure was ready.

The same holds for our future products. It’s not about speed alone. It’s about 𝗯𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆, 𝗯𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗲𝗲𝗽, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗻𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘀𝗲𝗲 𝘂𝘀 𝗮𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗮𝘂𝗹𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲.

This morning I found myself feeling grateful for being part of a company like Fixerra . 
Work from home can sometimes feel like you’re not fully in it, the updates don’t always flow the same way, and the work you do isn’t always visible. But that doesn’t mean the contribution is any less.

What makes all the difference is the trust and balance the team creates. At Fixerra , I’ve experienced a culture built on trust and where outcomes matter more than constant check-ins, and life outside of work is valued just as much.
Truly, that’s something worth being grateful for on a Monday.",17,2,1,4w,Akshar Shah reposted this,Arshya Dhawan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/arshya-dhawan-45b00886,https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshar-shah-09427b76/,2025-10-14T16:43:36.226Z,,2025-09-16T03:21:43.392Z,,

That’s been my view for a while.

Recently, though, I was speaking to a senior professional from a leading broking platform, and they were equally pessimistic on equities — stretched valuations, muted 1 year returns. Wealth managers have been circumspect too as the number of outstanding SIPs are reducing.

Back at XLRI, I remember choosing an elective that only a few picked — Social Entrepreneurship with Prof. Madhukar Shukla.

It wasn’t part of the “hot” marketing or finance specialisations, didn’t add much to credits, and certainly didn’t make for glamorous résumé points. But something about the idea of business serving more than profit drew me in.

On the first day, the classroom was almost empty — just a handful of us. But by the end of that semester, my mind felt fuller than it had in any other course. Prof. Shukla didn’t just teach; he made us live the course. We met social entrepreneurs who had built schools out of nothing, created livelihoods where there was none, and solved problems most of us never even noticed.

One moment that stayed with me was when a rural entrepreneur told us:

“The people I serve don’t need charity. They need a fair chance to stand on their own feet.”

It hit me — impact isn’t about 𝘨𝘪𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦, it’s about 𝘦𝘯𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦.

And in some ways, that’s what Independence Day is all about too. True freedom isn’t just the absence of restraint — it’s the presence of opportunity. And freedom flourishes when we enable others to stand tall.

That small, almost-forgotten elective changed how I think about business, purpose, and responsibility. It made me certain that entrepreneurship can be an act of nation-building — one business, one community, one idea at a time.

In fintech, there are two kinds of product & tech folks.

Type 1: “I’ve seen enough, I know how this works.” (Stops at PAN screen when checking any platform’s flow in the fintech ecosystem, assumes the rest is ‘standard.’)

Type 2: “Let’s see what happens next.” (Does the full KYC, books a ₹1,000 FD, applies for a loan or a card they’ll never take, runs 50 tiny transactions—just to see the cracks and the magic in that journey/backend.)

The first group imagines the product.
The second group 𝘧𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘴 it.

If you’re building fintech and haven’t walked through every step—on your own platform or others in the ecosystem—you’re almost building blindfolded.

At the start, even getting one large fintech, one bank, felt like a win. A guilty kind of happy.

Then, somewhere along the way, you want more.
And you don’t know when it happened — gradually, or all at once — but the bar moves. Again and again.

That’s the startup journey.
You hit one milestone, then quietly raise the bar. You don’t even stop to celebrate.
And sometimes, the ambition, the burn, the chase — all of it feels like a lot.
But maybe, amidst all of it, we forget to be thankful.

Thankful for the chance to pursue.

From one person starting Fixerra two and a half years ago…
…to a team of 20.
…to working with some of the largest platforms and banks in the country.

I said this in a casual chat with my founder while talking about how open a team might be about owning a mistake.

And it stuck with me.

Culture isn’t just about flexible hours or work life balance.
It’s about feeling safe, when things go wrong at work or in life.

I’ve realised culture also shows up when someone says:

“Bhai, tu log off kar de, main dekh lunga.”

That’s culture too.
When people cover for you, not because they have to, but because they care.
