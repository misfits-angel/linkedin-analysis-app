Immigrants are a foundational part of the US innovation economy. Our research shows they have founded nearly half of all American unicorns ‚Äì exceptional companies that create jobs, push technologies forward ‚Äì and change our daily lives. 

In total, our data shows that 65 countries have produced at least one founder of a US unicorn. Here is the list of countries with 10 or more US unicorn founders by continent:

‚Ä¢ Europe: The United Kingdom leads with 31 founders, followed by Germany (18), France (17), Russia (14), Ukraine (12), and Ireland (10).

‚Ä¢ Asia: India leads with 90 founders, followed by Israel (52), China (27), and Taiwan (12).

‚Ä¢ Africa: No countries with 10+ founders. South Africa leads with 5.

‚Ä¢ (South and North) America: Canada leads with 42 founders. There are no countries in South America with 10+ founders; Brazil has 9 founders. (For clarity, the US is excluded from this table.)

‚Ä¢ Australasia: No countries with 10+ founders. Australia and New Zealand produced 8 and 6 founders, respectively.

Beyond founding companies, immigrants are vital as employees at every level, complementing the local workforce. The flow of global talent is a critical ingredient for the success of the entire US tech ecosystem.

In India, why aren't we talking about super Intelligence, it is not just some western sci-fi Tech!
So here we go, 
below is my perspective, please share yours:
Super Intelligence inspired by Human Intelligence ?
Primary expected capabilities of super intelligence:
1.‚Å† ‚Å†Natively multimodal 
2.‚Å† ‚Å†Hierarchical reasoning 
3.‚Å† ‚Å†Incredibly good at Tool calling
4.‚Å† Hell lot of knowledge of everything including ‚ÄòSTEAM‚Äô
5.‚Å† ‚Å†Consciousness ü´¢ üòá üôå, far away but probably the dooms day thing.

Human intelligence:
1.‚Å† ‚Å†Multimodal: See, hear, touch, taste, smell (multimodal)
2.‚Å† ‚Å†Hierarchical thinking: What‚Äôs your name - no reasoning vs solve Pythagorean Theorem. High reasoning. Relatable example ?
3.‚Å† ‚Å†Tools calling:  Example: Task 1: fill this paper form. Action: Read, find a pen, start writing. Task 2: post about Super Intelligence on LinkedIn. Action: Think, find a phone, open LI, type.
4.‚Å† ‚Å†Knowledge: This will become the key differentiator alongside compute and memory.
5.‚Å† ‚Å†Consciousness: A simple way to describe is this quote by Martin Luther King Jr. : ‚ÄúIf you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.

I am thrilled to share that Ravinder Kumar, #IITStartupsIndia cohort member and Tecnod8.AI Founder, is busy evaluating term sheets after a successful pitch at #PIWOT25 Demo Day!
Tecnod8.AI is on a mission to make the application of Industrial Engineering as easy as DIY, through GenerativeAI.
Ravinder Kumar, Founder & CEO has been working in the #Robotics & #Automation Industry for 15 years, having previously worked with the world's leading Industrial Robots Manufacturer. Tecnod8.AI has a founding team from different IITs including Akshar S., Sandeep Sharma, Niyati Madaan, Rajat Kumar and Akshat Jain. Tecnod8.AI is incubated at IIT Mandi Catalyst and IIM Bangalore NSRCEL.
Amid 4th Industrial Revolution while industrial enterprises want to Automate more & more manufacturing processes, there is no easy way to conceptualize, build, deploy and maintain Automated machines. Tecnod8.AI is aiming to make this as easy as DIY through their¬†Full Stack #GenAI co-pilot for Industrial Engineering. Tecnod8.AI‚Äôs vision is to democratise #IndustrialEngineering with their Full stack #GenAI co-pilot¬†to help industrial enterprises easily adopt, deploy and maintain Automated Technology systems to boost their shop floor productivity.
Within 10 months of its incorporation, Tecnod8.AI has received multiple Grants and Equity-based funding from IIT Mandi Catalyst and iHub. Furthermore, it is working on paid pilots with Defense Organizations and has been selected for Maruti Suzuki Accelerator. Tecnod8.AI is also supported by Nasscom #GenAI Foundry. It is in active discussion with various VCs including international VCs from Germany, UK and USA, to raise their pre-seed round.
Tecnod8.AI is well poised to disrupt the US$ 1.03 Trillion #IndustrialEngineering market.


#IITStartupsIndia wishes Ravinder Kumar much success as he builds Tecnod8.AI into a significant player in India‚Äôs #GenAI startup landscape.
