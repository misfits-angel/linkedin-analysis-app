Immigrants are a foundational part of the US innovation economy. Our research shows they have founded nearly half of all American unicorns – exceptional companies that create jobs, push technologies forward – and change our daily lives. 

In total, our data shows that 65 countries have produced at least one founder of a US unicorn. Here is the list of countries with 10 or more US unicorn founders by continent:

• Europe: The United Kingdom leads with 31 founders, followed by Germany (18), France (17), Russia (14), Ukraine (12), and Ireland (10).

• Asia: India leads with 90 founders, followed by Israel (52), China (27), and Taiwan (12).

• Africa: No countries with 10+ founders. South Africa leads with 5.

• (South and North) America: Canada leads with 42 founders. There are no countries in South America with 10+ founders; Brazil has 9 founders. (For clarity, the US is excluded from this table.)

• Australasia: No countries with 10+ founders. Australia and New Zealand produced 8 and 6 founders, respectively.

Beyond founding companies, immigrants are vital as employees at every level, complementing the local workforce. The flow of global talent is a critical ingredient for the success of the entire US tech ecosystem.

In India, why aren't we talking about super Intelligence, it is not just some western sci-fi Tech!
So here we go, 
below is my perspective, please share yours:
Super Intelligence inspired by Human Intelligence ?
Primary expected capabilities of super intelligence:
1.⁠ ⁠Natively multimodal 
2.⁠ ⁠Hierarchical reasoning 
3.⁠ ⁠Incredibly good at Tool calling
4.⁠ Hell lot of knowledge of everything including ‘STEAM’
5.⁠ ⁠Consciousness 🫢 😇 🙌, far away but probably the dooms day thing.

Human intelligence:
1.⁠ ⁠Multimodal: See, hear, touch, taste, smell (multimodal)
2.⁠ ⁠Hierarchical thinking: What’s your name - no reasoning vs solve Pythagorean Theorem. High reasoning. Relatable example ?
3.⁠ ⁠Tools calling:  Example: Task 1: fill this paper form. Action: Read, find a pen, start writing. Task 2: post about Super Intelligence on LinkedIn. Action: Think, find a phone, open LI, type.
4.⁠ ⁠Knowledge: This will become the key differentiator alongside compute and memory.
5.⁠ ⁠Consciousness: A simple way to describe is this quote by Martin Luther King Jr. : “If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.
