But what if I tell you Synthefy’s time series generative models can adhere to such “hard constraints” with strict guarantees. 

That’s why I’m excited to share our new NeurIPS 2025 paper on constrained time series generation.

In this work, we show how to generate high-quality synthetic time series that satisfy hard real-world constraints. Hard constraints are everywhere – from financial time series to the physical world. Imagine asking:
“Generate the Tesla stock price for the next month with a volatility of 5%.”
“Generate the temperature for an oil refinery sensor, ensuring it stays below 120°F.”

Our models make this possible — enforcing constraints while keeping the data realistic and statistically consistent.

If you’re working in finance, engineering, healthcare, or wireless and want to generate or simulate constrained synthetic data, you can use the Synthefy Self-Serve Platform. Apply for access here: https://tally.so/r/meg0Ql.

Huge shoutout to Sai Shankar Narasimhan for leading this — he teaches me something new every week.

The Synthefy team and I will be at NeurIPS (San Diego) this year — DM if you’d like to meet!

Traditional product analytics tools e.g. Google Analytics, Amplitude, PostHog, etc were built for clicks, not conversations.

In web or mobile, you can track a user journey:
Button clicked → Page viewed → Item purchased

But in AI Companion apps?
Type → Press Enter → Type again

That’s it.
No events. No funnels. No visibility into why users do what they do.

So when your Product Manager asks:
1️⃣ Why are users dropping off?
2️⃣ What features are driving retention?
3️⃣ How can I increase paying user%?
4️⃣ Which A/B experiments should I run?

You can’t answer because the signal is buried inside unstructured chat logs and voice transcripts.

The truth: your AI Companion isn’t missing features → it’s missing user understanding.

You need analytics that will decode black box natural language: extracting user insights and mapping to product KPIs for driving business growth.

You might have read two isolated headlines:
🛒 Shopping is becoming native to The Sales Mind
📢 OpenAI is building in-house advertising team
 
Guess what? 
They’re deeply connected!

But why?
Because the shopping funnel is being rebuilt inside the chat interface:
Discovery → influenced by Ads + prompts
Consideration → personalized conversations with ChatGPT
Checkout → one-click, agentic, powered by Stripe

This is the holy grail of digital commerce: ad → conversation → purchase, all without leaving the chat.

Brands and sellers, it's time to think beyond 'click' to 'conversations'
👉 Start working on GEO to rethink how their products are “indexed” in AI-native environments. Use products like Profound, Peec AI, etc.
👉 Understand user behaviour in conversations of your platform using tools like Dimension Labs, Botanalytics, etc.

We’re not just talking about AI assistants anymore. We’re talking about the next platform for commerce + advertising, with 700M users already inside the ChatGPT mall.

✅ Double down on unique customer value
✅ Focus energy where it truly differentiates

After 10+ years in web and AI, I realised the web is going to completely change with the introduction of web AI agents. If you haven't used browser agents like Comet (Perplexity) or Operator Agent (The Sales Mind), sorry to say but you are still living in the Stone Age.

When you ignore this traffic:
⚠️ Your site only serves humans, not AI agents → you miss future traffic & interactions
⚠️ You reinvent the wheel with proprietary APIs → higher cost, lower interoperability
⚠️ You slow down network effects → fewer consumers use and build on your work

Instead, leverage protocol-first design for the AI Web.

Here’s how:
1️⃣ Adopt open protocols like NLWeb (Microsoft AI) & MCP (Anthropic))
– Treat natural language endpoints as core infrastructure
– Use the same APIs for both humans and AI agents
– Future-proof your site against agent-driven browsing

2️⃣ Leverage existing semantic layers
– Use Schema[dot]org and RSS (already on 100M+ websites)
– Expose structured data (JSON) alongside natural language
– Reduce friction for agents to interpret your content

3️⃣ Contribute, don’t just consume
– Share sample implementations with the community
– Build interoperable endpoints, not walled gardens
– Treat this like the early Web: barn-raising, not gatekeeping

This is an evolving space, so keep yourself updated to avoid loosing out on this generational behaviour shift.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7371514371081990144,,Text,"A simple trick to make LLMs more predictable and deterministic (without fine-tuning)

While making the LLM call:
✔️ Set temperature = 0 → always picks the most likely token
✔️ Keep top_p = 0.01 (or ≤0.1 if you must use it) → reduces token sampling randomness
✔️ Combine both → deterministic, repeatable outputs every time

Why it matters:
✅ Stable outputs (no surprises in downstream pipelines)
✅ Reliable classifications & extractions
✅ Easier caching and debugging

Example config:
response = client[dot]chat[dot]completions[dot]create(
 model=""gpt-4o-mini"",
 messages=[{""role"":""user"",""content"":""Classify: 'Refund not received'""}],
 temperature=0,
 top_p=1.0
)

Run this twice, thrice, or a hundred times → you’ll get the same answer. Perfect for enterprise-grade workflows where predictability > creativity.

(hint: screenshots)

👴 OLD WAY
Most browsers were designed to render static documents. They wait for user input: URLs, clicks, scripts.

👶 NEW WAY
Agentic AI browsers like Comet by Perplexity or Dia and Arc by The Browser Company or takes a different approach: it behaves more like an autonomous agent orchestrator than a traditional client.

Here’s how Comet works under the hood:
1️⃣ Live Retrieval
Instead of relying on cached indices, Comet issues real-time HTTP requests, parses DOM structures, and ingests structured/unstructured data (see attached flow diagram).
2️⃣ Contextual Reasoning
LLMs interpret retrieved content, grounding outputs in source material while avoiding hallucinations.
3️⃣ Action Layer
Beyond retrieval, Comet can act: drafting comparisons, executing workflows, or chaining multi-step tasks via agent calls.
4️⃣ Feedback Loop
User prompts refine the reasoning loop—effectively turning the browser into a stateful agent environment, not just a view layer.

From a systems perspective: Comet is closer to a runtime for autonomous information agents than a browser. It blends:
✅ Retrieval (like a search engine)
✅ Reasoning (via LLMs)
✅ Execution (multi-agent task orchestration)

This evolution points to a broader trend: Browsers as programmable AI agents, surfing, reasoning, and executing without requiring users to micromanage every click.

Question for builders: How will we design websites and mobile apps for a world where the browser is no longer just a window?

Question for users: what limitations have you come across while using these AI browsers?

Sorry, it's not the optimal solution.

A recent paper from researchers at Microsoft, Walmart Global Tech and SunitechAI tested 16 key scenarios on OpenAI's GPT-4o and DeepSeek AI's V3-0324 to showcase the trade-offs and help the builders of real-world AI applications take better infra decisions.

✂️ TL;DR: For AI Agentic workflows demanding strong logical reasoning, deep customisation, or cost-efficiency, DeepSeek is a powerful, adaptable choice.

Consider DeepSeek as your LLM for:

✅ Logical & Mathematical Reasoning
DeepSeek's architecture is purpose built for complex reasoning tasks, excelling in logic puzzles, multi-step maths, and scientific problem-solving, often outperforming on benchmarks like MATH and LiveCodeBench.

✅ Cost-Optimised Deployments
DeepSeek is ideal for budget-conscious, high-volume agent applications for developing markets like APAC, LATAM, and Africa. Because it achieves high performance at a fraction of GPT-4's training cost (estimated $5-6 million vs. over $100 million for GPT-4).

✅  Highly Customised Agents
With its open weights and MIT license, DeepSeek offers unparalleled fine-tuning flexibility (LoRA, QLoRA) on consumer hardware. This is perfect for deeply tailoring agents to specific domains or proprietary data.

✅ Research & Reproducibility
Its open-weight philosophy allows researchers to inspect components, test hypotheses, and replicate results, a transparency often absent in closed-source models.

The Problem Today:
⚠️ Engagement ≠ pipeline → LinkedIn likes/comments often just sit there with no follow-up
⚠️ Manual data entry → Turning post engagement into usable CRM contacts takes hours (copying names, finding emails, verifying, etc.)
⚠️ Missed timing → By the time a marketer or SDR reaches out, the “intent signal” from the engagement is cold
⚠️ Fragmented outreach → Cold emails, LinkedIn invites, and CRM entries usually happen in silos, leading to broken sequences and lost opportunities

I have been running a workflow that solves exactly this: 
1️⃣ Scrape profiles of like & comment
2️⃣ Enrich contact data
3️⃣ Launch personalized emails
4️⃣ Send LinkedIn invites
5️⃣ Hubspot CRM sync

Fascinating new research reveals that Visual Language Models (VLMs) from Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and OpenAI are perfect at recognizing common visuals, but fail miserably when those patterns change aka counterfactuals.

✅ 100% accuracy for common visuals:
Zebra → 4 legs
adidas logo → 3 stripes

❌ 17% accuracy for counterfactuals:
Mutated Zebra → 5 legs
adidas-like logo → 4 stripes

The takeaway?
This means AI isn’t truly seeing; it’s recalling what it “knows” from training data.

This has big implications for marketers:
⚠️ Brand safety: AI-powered brand detection in ads or user-generated content may miss counterfeits, altered logos, or spoofed creative.
⚠️ Creative analysis: Campaign testing tools using VLMs might misinterpret visual elements if they deviate from “standard” patterns.
⚠️ Market research: Visual sentiment or competitor analysis could be skewed as it combines visual reasoning with pattern recognition

As AI becomes embedded in marketing workflows, the next wave of VLM innovation will need to focus less on “what’s familiar” and more on what’s actually there.

The big opportunity: Partner with AI marketing vendors who are actively evaluating and training for counterfactual accuracy.

Are you also tired of the endless loop of manually finding and repurposing viral videos for every single social media platform?

There's an autonomous workflow that automates the entire process, so you can focus on creativity, not manual labor.

Here’s how it works: 👇 

✅ TRIGGER: Send a single TikTok link to a Telegram Messenger bot.

✅ ANALYSIS: The workflow downloads the video, transcribes the audio, and uses AI (Perplexity & GPT-4o) to rewrite the script and caption, giving you a fresh take in the same viral niche.

✅ CREATION: It then generates a brand-new video with your custom AI avatar using Captions.ai and adds subtitles and overlay text.

✅ DISTRIBUTION: The final video is automatically published to 9 platforms: TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, etc

Please don’t use AI to generate Ads. 🚫 📣

I am Founder of an AI marketing company, and I am telling you this. Hear me out:

1️⃣ Marketing teams have spent decades perfecting ad-creative strategies for different channels. They know what resonates and what flops. It's an art as much as it is a science.

2️⃣ Most online data about “best ad practices” is junk. Everyone's a self-proclaimed expert these days, but real expertise is rare. A lot of what you read is just noise.

3️⃣ And that junk is what most LLMs are trained on. If you train a model on garbage, well, you know the saying—garbage in, garbage out.

What you really want is to replicate how a great marketer would create ads. You want that spark of creativity, that unique touch that catches the eye and holds the attention 👩‍🎨 🎨

But here’s the challenge:

⚠️ There’s little online data on how top marketers craft ads. The real secrets, the winning formulas, aren’t posted on blogs or shared in forums. They’re the hard-won insights of seasoned pros.

⚠️ Writing effective prompts for ad generation takes years of experience. It’s not just about the words you use; it’s about understanding the audience, the medium, the moment.

The worst part? The internet is being flooded with mediocre AI-generated Ads, which models are then retrained on, making the problem even bigger. It's a vicious cycle of mediocrity threatening to drown out genuine creativity 📉🔻

💡Use AI wisely, like how Dove came up with this brilliant Ad (attached) that won the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity - Media Grand Prix for championing 'Real Beauty' in the Age of AI.

According to the recently out Liftoff Mobile’s 2025 Mobile Ad Creative Index (link in comments):

📈 Playable ads deliver up to massive 16x higher conversion rates than non-Playable formats.
🕹️ Top gaming advertisers spent 35% more on Playables, as they get 8x higher ITI (impression to install) rates than non-Playable ads
💵 Liftoff recorded a 20% YoY growth in Interactive ad spend among top advertisers

It’s clear: Interactivity drives performance 🏎️ 💨 

At ArcPlay.ai, we’re betting big on this shift by distributing Playables beyond games, into mainstream consumer apps. The future of mobile advertising is engaging, opt-in and fun 🎮 

Let’s talk if you're building for this future 🤙

Sett.ai has just opened its Early Access Program, and if you're in mobile gaming or app space, this is the update you can't afford to ignore.

For years, gaming UA teams have struggled with:
❌ High costs of Playable creative production
⏳ Slow turnaround times
🧠 Heavy manual input with limited scalability

That ends now.

Sett is the first agentic platform built to automate the creation, testing, and iteration of Playable Ads at scale - no templates, no repetitive concepts - just original, high-performing creative produced faster than ever. Kudos to Amit and team.

The impact?
💰 Drastically reduced creative costs
⚡ Rapid experimentation and optimization
🎯 Better performance with fewer resources

This is a game-changer for game and app studios spending hundreds of thousands on Playables annually. Imagine scaling your winning ads 10x faster and at 20x less cost.

👉 Early access is live. To sign-up check the link in Akin's post.

🤔 Wait....now that you are able to create Playable ads in volume, how would you distribute it?

🦸‍♂️ Don't worry!! ArcPlay is building the next-gen distribution channel for Playable ads. Stay tuned for more ;)

With over 5 billion daily brand impressions and 10,000+ advertisers, Truecaller Ads is already a serious player. But with the launch of Truecaller Play, they’re stepping into the next era (link to afaqs! article in comments):

📹 Video and interactive, high-engagement ad formats natively built into the natural app experience.

Until now, interactive ad innovation was largely dominated by gaming. With GenAI solving the production of Video and Interactive ad creatives, this move shows how non-gaming platforms are now building immersive ad inventories that drive real performance.

Why this matters:
🔐 Powered by first-party data
📍 Delivered at high-attention moments
🧩 Designed to seamlessly blend into the app UX
🎯 Backed by in-house creative support and targeting tools

🦸‍♂️ As Hemant Arora (VP Global Ad Sales Business - Truecaller) puts it: ""It’s about placing your story exactly where attention is highest and distractions are lowest.""

🌈 We’re watching a shift unfold where consumer apps across the spectrum are becoming the new battleground for high-conversion, performance-focused ads that create value for both advertisers and users.

🤔 How is your consumer app tapping into the performance advertising dollars?

Why this is a huge deal (Reuters link in comments):
1️⃣ Google Chrome powers ~66% of the world’s web browsing and is a critical data engine for Google's $200B+ ad business
2️⃣ OpenAI’s new browser is expected to keep users within a ChatGPT-like interface, changing how we discover and interact with the web
3️⃣ With 500M weekly ChatGPT users, OpenAI could quickly gain serious traction and valuable data
4️⃣ It’s built on Chromium, Google’s open-source codebase the same one Chrome is built on.
5️⃣ Plus, it integrates AI agents (like Operator) that can take actions for users: booking tickets, filling forms, and more right from within the browser.

👀 Fun fact: OpenAI has already hired ex-Google VPs from the original Chrome team. And yes, they had even considered buying Chrome if Google was forced to sell.

Why It’s a Game-Changer for Digital Advertising:
🛣️ Full user journey control: 
OpenAI’s browser keeps users within a ChatGPT-style experience, reducing reliance on 3P websites
🗣️ Shift from search to conversation: 
Discovery moves from typing into a box to chatting with an assistant, redefining brand strategies.
⚡ Faster funnel: 
AI-powered interactions mean users skip steps, shortening the path from awareness to conversion.
🛍️ New ad formats: 
AI agents embedded in the browser can book, buy, or recommend, ads become actions, not just banners or videos.

🌅 This marks the start of a new ad economy: AI-native, performance-first, and radically personalized. 

⁉️ Are you (Advertiser, Publisher or AdTech) prepared for this tectonic shift?

It just got super easy 🙌

Last week, Uber unlocked its ad inventory via Google DV360, The Trade Desk, and Yahoo DSP and while it may have gotten buried in the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity buzz, this move is a watershed moment for retail and commerce media. (Thanks Matthew Newcomb for posting about this)

At first glance, it’s another RMN scaling access. But in reality, it signals a strategic shift. 🫨 

Uber’s pitch? High performance, now at scale:
📈 3%+ CTR
⏱️ 100+ seconds average global view time
💡 80% of users say ads caught their attention

And it’s not just Uber making moves:
🚗 Lyft has added video ads and enhanced targeting
🛒 Instacart just received Media Ratings Council accreditation for 3 ad formats

As programmatic dollars flow in, RMNs will shift from walled gardens to interoperable ecosystems, prioritizing new, high-impact ad inventory  in apps, in stores, in transit to capture a larger share of media budgets. 💰 

This is commerce media evolving from owned and operated, to open and optimized.⚡

Two recent events have caught my eye, suggesting a shift in how ""earning"" is integrating with ""playing"": ✨

1️⃣ GetZoot, co-founded by gaming veteran Sean Ryan, raised $6M from Griffin and CoinFund to build a free-to-play gaming platform infused with sweepstakes prize mechanics, a clever way to drive engagement without stepping into murky regulatory waters.

2️⃣ Plutus Labs, co-founded by Karata Dasmahapatra, backed by a16z speedrun and Konvoy, seems to have pivoted from influencer-led prediction markets to a Play-to-Earn model tailored for GenZ.

These aren't your typical blockchain-heavy P2E games. They seem to be focused on:
📱 Accessibility: Hyper-casual, free-to-play.
⚡ Instant Gratification: Instant payouts, quick matches. 
✅ Regulated/Clear Value: Real money, sweepstakes, compliant markets. 

🌊 Could this be the next wave of P2E!!
one that's less about Web3 mechanics and more about engaging, skill-based, or chance-based earning within familiar gaming formats 🤔

💭 What are your thoughts on this trend? Are we seeing a mainstreaming of earning through play? 

P.S: At ArcPlay, we're inspired by this evolution and taking it one step further. We're bringing Play-to-Earn to advertising by reimagining Playable Ads. DM me to learn more. 😉

With AI-powered search reducing traffic to publisher websites and 95% of users unwilling to pay for subscriptions, Google For Publishers just launched Offerwall (Beta), giving web publishers new tools to monetize without relying solely on clicks. (TechCrunch link in comments)

📦 What’s inside? Offerwall gives users flexible access options like:
1. Watch-to-unlock (rewarded ads)
2. Micropayments for content (powered by Supertab)
3. Surveys-to-unlock (rewarded surveys)
4. newsletter signups & more (add your custom offer)

🧠  All backed by AI to optimize engagement and revenue timing and early tests show approx 9% revenue lifts.

🔥 Tailwind Beyond Websites
This signals a broader shift: non-gaming consumer apps can now seriously explore microtransactions and rewarded ads as viable monetization models - from entertainment and productivity to education and news.

🎮 At ArcPlay.ai, we are already thinking ahead of the curve:
Instead of boring watch to unlock, we are pioneering Play-To-Unlock driven by Agentic AI to bring interactive, playable, rewarded experiences into everyday apps. It’s native, user-friendly, and unlocks massive value for both users and app developers.

🎯 One key takeaway: AI is fast-tracking game development and the studios that win will be the ones with the strongest UA game.

With AI slashing production timelines:
✅ Game loops are prototyped in days
✅ Art, levels & voiceovers generated at scale
✅ A/B testing is practically real-time

The result? A flood of new games, faster than ever. 
But in this new era, making a great game isn’t enough. You have to scale it.

🕹️  This is where Playable ads take center stage. Users acquired via Playables show higher retention and LTV than those from video or banner ads because they’ve already experienced the core gameplay before installing.

🤖 Playable ads = qualified users + full-funnel performance.

As AI makes game development easier, distribution becomes the real moat.
Studios that treat UA like a product testing, iterating, and optimising relentlessly will pull ahead.

The game has changed.......Growth is the new endgame and ArcPlay is re-imagining all things Playables 🚀

But How?? 🤔 

New global research by Deloitte and Google Ads confirms what leading publishers and advertisers already know. (link in comments)

✨ Great ad experiences drive revenue growth✨

When mobile gaming ads are designed with user respect and functionality in mind, the benefits are clear:
✅ 72% of gamers continue playing after a high-quality ad
✅ 20% prefer these games over others because of better ad experiences
✅ Higher retention leads to stronger ARPU and long-term monetization

So what defines a high-quality ad experience?
✔️ Clear, expected controls (skip, close, mute)
✔️ No forced redirects or misleading interactivity
✔️ Rewarded ads with transparent value exchange

What can you do?
🧩 Game advertisers:
1 Invest in creatives that respect user flow (e.g. Playables), no bait-and-switch
📱 Non-gaming publishers:
1. Audit your current ad placements for disruptiveness
2. Introduce Rewarded ad placements to maximise LTV and user retention 

📣 In a crowded mobile ecosystem, user-first ad design isn't just good UX, it's a competitive advantage. Prioritize quality and watch your retention, brand perception, and revenue grow together.

It’s true and they call it 'Gamified Experiences' with Alexa (yeah those cute little toys sitting around our bedside tables)

These aren’t just vanilla ads. They’re interactive brand experiences that let users talk, tap, or click their way through brand stories, exclusive content, and even product discovery, all through voice or screen on Alexa-enabled devices. (link in comments)

Why this matters for Ecom sellers?

🧠 Interactivity = higher recall & deeper brand affinity
🛍️ Blurs the line between entertainment + commerce
📺 Brings play into the home through a medium people already trust

Playable ads aren’t just for games anymore they’re for everyone who wants attention to convert into impact.

Meta is rolling out new surfaces in the Updates tab (used by 1.5B+ people daily globally) and for the first time, we can now reach, convert, and retain players natively on WhatsApp.

Key updates:
📢 Promoted Channels = top-of-funnel reach in WhatsApp's directory
🧲 Ads in Status = full-screen, skippable placements driving click-to-chat or install
💬 Channel Subscriptions = monthly monetization + exclusive content loop

Why it matters for gaming:
👥 94% of WhatsApp users open the app daily
🤩 Click-to-chat campaigns on WA already show 2–3x CTR vs. mobile web
💰 Player engagement in messaging channels drives 30–60% higher LTV when paired with CRM

This is the first time UA and live ops teams can:
✔️ Build a fanbase inside WhatsApp
✔️ Run paid acquisition with 1:1 opt-in comms
✔️ Monetize via subscriptions + microdrops

Messaging ≠ just CRM anymore: it's becoming a full funnel growth channel.

Playable ads have traditionally been the secret weapon of gaming companies to boost installs and drive ROAS. But in 2024, we’re witnessing a major shift: non-gaming categories are now among the top adopters of Playable creatives.

📊 According to new data from SocialPeta Ltd and Playable Factory, the Top 20 advertisers using Playable Ads this year include a wide range of breakout names:

💸 Fintech: Revolut, Capital(dot)com - using interactive ads to drive better user education and onboarding.
🛍️ E-commerce: SHEIN, OTTO - turning product discovery into an engaging, gamified experience.
🎵 Entertainment: Even TikTok is on the list - proof that Playables are now being used to engage massive mainstream audiences.

This evolution shows that Playable Ads are no longer niche or limited to gaming apps. They're becoming a core format for performance marketers across industries, especially those looking to drive meaningful engagement for get high LTV installs.

And yet most of these ads are still shown inside gaming environments. That’s a missed opportunity and exactly where ArcPlay.ai comes in. More on that later 😉 

Which other non-gaming brands have seen advertising using Playable ads? Let me get the ball rolling: Temu, Zepto, KFC......

While OpenAI and others are focussed on solving for the top 1% by charging premium fee and building premium features. The champion of mass market adoption using free to use tech - Meta just rolled out two powerful updates to WhatsApp that could reshape how we use AI in daily life and how brands connect with users:

🤖  Chat with AI by Third-Party Creators (link in comments):
- Users can now message AIs created by independent developers
- Enables unique, character-driven, or utility-focused chat experiences
- Adds a new layer of engagement beyond just people-to-people conversations

👨‍🎨 AI Studio (link in comments):
- A no-code platform to build and deploy AIs on WhatsApp
- Lets businesses, creators, and developers launch custom AI chatbots
- Great for support, content delivery, commerce, and brand storytelling

💥 How This Could Disrupt Brand Engagement:
- Scalable Personalization: Brands can build on-brand AI personas to chat 1:1 with millions of users
- New Commerce Layer: Chatbots can guide purchases, recommend products, and close sales directly in-app
- Owned Engagement Channel: Brands can build deeper relationships without depending on social feed algorithms
- Interactive Campaigns: From quizzes to product try-ons — AI chat can make marketing fun and engaging
- Always On Support: Instant, intelligent customer assistance without the cost of scaling teams

WhatsApp is going to become a conversational AI playground and this might be the biggest unlock for brand engagement since the rise of Instagram Stories. It would be interesting to see how Meta plans to monetise this thus enabling the creator/ developer ecosystem, apart from using this to feed data to its advertising engines.

Is This For Real? 😳 😳

As per the 2025 report by SocialPeta Ltd and Playable Factory, non-gaming advertisers are getting ~319% higher conversion from Playable ads. The genre wise break-up is mentioned in the attached bar chart.

WHAT ARE PLAYABLE ADS? 
Traditionally used by gaming apps to boost installs, Playable Ads (or interactive ad formats) that let users try before they buy are now unlocking powerful conversion opportunities for non-gaming apps and brands.

WHY THEY WORK?
1️⃣ Engagement: Unlike passive video ads, playable ads turn users into participants. This boosts attention rate by 47% compared to video ads.
2️⃣ Intent signalling: A user who engages with a mini-experience is already leaning in—making them more likely to convert.
3️⃣ Personalization: With GenAI tools, brands can now dynamically generate playable creatives tailored to different audience segments.

WHO ARE ADOPTING THESE? AND FOR WHAT?
🛒  E-commerce: 5-10% Virtual try-ons or product interactions
👟 Fitness/Health: 3-5% Interactive demos of workout routines
📚 EdTech: 2-4% Mini-quizzes or skill demos
📸 Social/Entertainment: 1-3% Filters or short UGC tools

👉 In a world where attention is the currency, interactivity is the new ad creative. Are you exploring playables outside of gaming? Would love to hear your thoughts.

The rumoured acquisition of TikTok by Applovin (link in comments) isn't just another tech deal - it could be a watershed moment for the entire AdTech landscape.

HERE'S WHY?
🔹 An Alternative to Google Ads & Meta's Walled Gardens: This deal could position Applovin as a legitimate challenger to Google and Meta, offering advertisers a fresh ecosystem to drive ROAS outside traditional search and social platforms.

🔹 A Major Shake-Up for Gaming & Non-Gaming Apps: TikTok’s influence extends beyond entertainment, shaping consumer behavior across shopping, fintech, and lifestyle apps. With Applovin’s game-centric expertise, this could mean a new era of ad monetization strategies beyond rewarded videos.

🔹 Gaming AdTech Meets Social Commerce at Scale: Applovin, a dominant force in mobile advertising and game app monetization, would gain direct access to TikTok’s 1Bn+ engaged users. This merger could create an unprecedented blend of social media influence and programmatic ad efficiency.

🔹 Ready Playbook: Applovin has already done this in gaming space in the past by acquiring game studios like Lion Studios, a Tripledot Studio and PeopleFun to gather rich user dat and train its AXON AI model. So, with TikTok they have to repeat this once again for non-gaming space.

🔹 The Rise of Playable & Interactive Ads: Applovin has been pioneering Playable Ads in mobile games. With TikTok’s short-video format and creator economy, we could see the evolution of deeply engaging ad experiences powered by AI-driven personalization.

If this deal happens, it won’t just be a headline - it could mark a seismic shift in how ads are created, distributed, and monetized. 🚀

It’s no secret that customer acquisition costs (CAC) is skyrocketing, making it harder than ever for mobile apps and games to scale profitably. 🚀

What’s driving the surge?
⚡ Increased competition – More apps, games and brands (read eCom) are flooding the market and fighting for the same users.
🔒 Privacy changes – Limited tracking (thanks to ATT & GDPR) is reducing targeting efficiency.

So, what’s the way forward?
✅ Retention-first strategies – Keeping users engaged matters more than ever using mechanics such as Hybrid Casual
✅ Playable & interactive ads – Higher intent capture leading to better conversion rates.

Streaming is evolving, with India leading the shift to ad-supported models. As subscriptions stagnate, freemium strategies are reshaping OTT platforms and creating new opportunities for brands.

📊 Key Trends:
- Ad-supported streaming drove 47% of global OTT adoption in Q2 2024.
- India’s OTT audience grew 14% in 2024 to 547.3M, with a 21% surge in AVoD audiences.
- Netflix’s ad-tier pricing has been a global success and could debut in India soon, making premium content affordable.

🚀 Amazon’s Moves:
- The merger of Amazon miniTV and Amazon MX Player created India’s largest free streaming platform, with 250M+ users.
- Starting in 2025, Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios India will feature ads, following success in markets like the US and UK.

💻 Tech’s Role in CTV:
The Trade Desk’s Ventura - Connected TV (CTV) OS - is set to redefine ad targeting, offering brands tools to engage audiences more effectively.

📉 Google’s Missed Ads Opportunity:
Despite owning desktop with Google Chrome and mobile with Android, Google fell behind in the CTV race. Platforms like Amazon Fire TV and Roku have dominated, leaving Google’s Chromecast with a smaller market share. In a rapidly growing CTV ecosystem, this is a rare slip for the tech giant. 

This is going to be a massive regret as Google could have eaten up the Ads revenue which was traditionally behind the walls of linear TV operators.

🌟 Why It Matters?
Price-sensitive markets like India are perfect for freemium models, while CTV’s rise signals a massive shift in how OTT content is monetised via ads.

📚 Rohit Choudhary (Seekho) - If users find value in your product, they will pay for it. Don’t hesitate to introduce a paywall

🛕 Prashant Sachan (AppsForBharat) - Understand the why behind your users' willingness to pay. If your product isn’t solving a painkiller-level problem, identify a stronger use case that organically makes them pay

🦹 Sanidhya Narain (Dashverse) - While Bharat offers immense potential, don’t limit your product to India. Explore developed markets like North America, where higher willingness to pay and greater ARPU can drive significant growth

As a founder, staying ahead in monetization trends is crucial, and this event delivered actionable strategies that can truly elevate revenue growth.

The AppsFlyer State of App Marketing and Monetization Report 2024 reveals just how critical ROAS is to driving sustainable growth. Here are some eye-opening insights:

💡 Hybrid Monetization Wins: Apps that combine In-App Purchases (IAP) with In-App Advertising (IAA) are seeing 300% Day 90 ROAS in Mid-core iOS games, compared to just 200% with IAP alone. This approach maximizes revenue streams without sacrificing user experience 🎮📊.

📊 Paid Traffic Drives Revenue: In Casual and Hypercasual games, 73% of revenue comes from paid traffic sources. This shows how critical it is to invest in high-performing, targeted ad campaigns for scalable growth 📲💸.

🎯 Platform Matters: Non-gaming subscription apps report an ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of $8.39 on iOS, compared to $1.54 on Android. For marketers, platform-specific strategies are no longer optional—they’re essential 🌍📱.

What Does This Mean for App Developers?

🧭 ROAS is not just a metric—it’s a compass guiding every marketing and monetization decision.

🥗 Diversified monetization models, particularly hybrid strategies, unlock higher revenue and longer user lifetimes 

⚖️ Aligning marketing spend with monetization data ensures every dollar spent drives measurable results

In today’s app ecosystem, maximizing ROAS isn’t about one-size-fits-all strategies. It’s about leveraging data to tailor campaigns, test new monetization models, and meet users where they are.

How are you aligning monetization to optimize ROAS for 2025?

Applovin has cracked the code of M&A with a chain of successful acquistions:

2014 - moboqo - Mobile advertising network for game developers
2018 - MAX - Programmatic ad buying platform 
2019 - SafeDK - Ad management platform
2020 - Machine Zone - Mobile game developer 
2021 - Adjust - Mobile marketing provider
2021 - MoPub has been acquired by AppLovin - Mobile ad serving platform for publishers
2022 - Wurl - CTV ads solutions
2022 - Wordle - Not the New York Times one but the OG Wordle game

In 2022, AppLovin proposed a $20 billion all-stock merger with Unity, but Unity rejected the offer in favor of acquiring ironSource. Fast forward to today, with Unity facing challenges like the controversial Runtime Fee and leadership changes, could there be a renewed case for a merger? 🤔

Here’s why this idea is worth revisiting:
📈 AppLovin’s Strength: AppLovin posted $1.06 billion in revenue in Q1 2024—a whopping 59.4% YoY increase. Its AI-driven monetization platform is a leader in scaling user acquisition and maximizing ad revenue.
📉 Unity’s Challenges: Unity reported $460 million in revenue in the same quarter—a decline of 8% YoY—while facing backlash over pricing and losing key leadership, including former CEO John Riccitiello.
🎯 Synergy in Gaming and AdTech: Together, AppLovin’s monetization engine and Unity’s 3D game creation tools could form a powerhouse for developers, offering end-to-end solutions from creation to monetization. Imagine the possibilities of a full-stack platform for building, scaling, and monetizing apps and games.

🔮 While a merger isn’t currently on the table, the dynamics of both companies—and their industry leadership—make this scenario one to watch. Could AppLovin’s growth strategy align with Unity’s need to rebuild trust and innovation?

🤔 What’s your take? 
Would this partnership create a win-win for developers or introduce new challenges in the gaming and ad tech landscape?

AdROAS (Ad Return on Ad Spend) provides the precision needed to track and optimize for high-ROI ad spend. As per industry sources this feature is only live for 50% of advertisers (doc link of Meta for Business in the comments). So, if you’re relying on in-app ads (IAA) for revenue, here’s why AdROAS is a must-have metric:

🏷️ Monetize Free Users Effectively: In apps where revenue is driven by ads instead of purchases, AdROAS lets you track exactly how much ad revenue each user contributes, enabling budget allocation that maximizes ad impressions rather than just installs.

🕵️ Granular Event Tracking: Measure ad revenue tied to events like banner clicks, rewarded video views, and interstitial interactions. AdROAS offers insight into which ad types generate the highest returns, allowing you to focus on the best-performing ad placements.

💰Optimize for High Lifetime Value (LTV) Users: AdROAS helps identify users with high LTV by tracking ongoing ad engagements, not just initial installs. This is crucial for IAA-based apps, where frequent engagement directly correlates to revenue.

📊 Gain Transparency in Revenue Streams: IAA revenue data, paired with AdROAS, enables full visibility into ad-driven revenue channels, letting you pinpoint high-value users that keep coming back to generate impressions.

🤩 This is positive signal for the app and game industry which is suffering from low RPMs and high CPIs. Though IAP has been growing over the years but still mamoth 60% of app revenue 🤯 is driven by IAA. AdROAS puts IAA-focused apps in the driver’s seat, letting marketers optimize budget based on blended revenue impact: IAP + IAAs.

🤔 But when will other UA platforms adopt AdROAS? 
🤔 Will Meta also recognise OfferWall revenue in AdROAS?

But will ads once again become the growth driver, this time also because of games?

NYT Games has been growing at such an explosive rate that, on a day in mid-October of 2023, the average daily active users in the Times Games app—iOS and Android combined—reached 2,615,333. These users aren't just coming to the NYT app to kill time; this is serious business. The NYT subscription bundle starts at $25 a month and surpassed 10 million subscribers in November, with a goal of 15 million by the end of 2027. “A lot of people are actually buying the bundle through our Games product,” says Alex Hardiman, Chief Product Officer at NYT.

But is subscription the only monetization lever for games? No—ads monetization accounts for 60% of revenue for casual games worldwide. So, what's NYT planning in this regard?

Joy Robins, Global Chief Advertising Officer of NYT, mentioned that The New York Times' puzzles and games were played more than 8 billion times last year, with 10 million daily gamers—more than many primetime television shows attract. This is a habitual, engaged, and high-income audience. New York Times Advertising is launching ads within its newest game, Connections, with launch sponsors like Uber Eats. Internal testing by New York Times Advertising has shown that this new ad placement ensures a non-disruptive user experience and is effective for advertisers (with a 0.60% average CTR from Wordle’s collaboration with DoorDash).

While news publishers have historically excelled at awareness-based ad campaigns on a massive scale, the high-engagement nature of games is proving effective at driving lower-funnel tactics. This is a great case study for SME non-gaming app publishers to consider incorporating ad-monetized casual games into their apps to boost their bottom line.

Did you know? 
The Washington Post has also experimented with games, albeit with mixed results. According to two sources familiar with the matter, the paper even considered buying Wordle but missed the opportunity, which was later seen as a significant loss after the Times acquired it.

YouTube's Playables is a strategic initiative aimed at capturing the attention of casual gamers by offering simple yet addictive games directly on its platform. While the company has been mum over the details, tech industry insiders predict a mid-2025 roll out.

Playables taps into the behavior of engaged YouTube users who are already 11% more likely to play mobile games, outperforming general U.S. gaming patterns. And what’s interesting is that while Playables is currently available only to Premium users, consumers who pay a fixed amount for an ad-free experience, when the general roll-out happens, expect your Playables to be punctuated by ads.

This is a massive opportunity for performance advertisers to tap into Youtube's audience which was esrtwhile a darling of brand advertisers. Expect interactive ad experiences in full-screen placements driving higher conversions.
