üîéIn the context of vibe coding, why is there little discussion or analysis on its application in large-scale product codebases beyond application-level, medium-scale, or simple projects? 

‚ö° The lack of visibility raises questions about its real-world impact, adoption challenges, and the proprietary nature of enterprise code intelligence systems.

1Ô∏è‚É£¬†Are these Code Intelligent AI systems really solving design-level challenges or just generating snippets of code?
2Ô∏è‚É£¬†A prompt can generate basic code.
3Ô∏è‚É£ A prompt can generate better code with more reusable methods and improved handling of multiple failure cases
4Ô∏è‚É£¬†How secure, maintainable, and scalable is AI-generated code?
‚ö†Ô∏è What happens when prompting-driven code generation overrides architectural decision-making?

‚úÖ However, understanding what you truly need is critical, otherwise, you risk compromising your design, code quality, and overall solution with AI-generated outputs.
