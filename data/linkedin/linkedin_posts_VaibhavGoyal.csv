So much is happening in AI right now that it feels almost impossible to keep up. Every day there’s a new model, a new framework, a new way of doing things.

That got me thinking — maybe the best way to learn AI now is to build with it.

I recently tried building a small AI tutor using ChatGPT itself with a prompt. It’s got simple commands, can quiz you, track your progress, and even guide your next step. And honestly, the process of making it taught me more than any video or article could.

There’s something special about using AI to learn AI — a bit like the tech teaching you about itself. That’s the kind of meta-learning I think we’ll see more of in the future.

It’s fun, fast, and surprisingly personal. Just give it a try and you will find learning AI much more interesting.

When people think of AI today, they often jump straight to “agents” — smart systems that can plan, reason, and act. But the truth is, success in AI doesn’t come from agents alone. It comes from designing the right workflow.

𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻’𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿

Not all tasks need an agent. The type of work matters.
1. Low variance, high standardization
Examples: regulatory disclosures, investor onboarding
Best fit: Rules-based automation + workflow software + predictive models

2. High variance, low standardization
Examples: compliance checks, extracting complex financial data
Best fit: Agentic AI


𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗽 “𝗔𝗜 𝗦𝗹𝗼𝗽”: 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

If users don’t trust AI, they won’t use it. That’s why we need strong evaluations to measure performance. Some useful evaluation methods include:
- Task success rate: How often does the agent complete the full job correctly without human help?
- F1 score (precision and recall): Useful when classification or decision-making must be accurate.
- Retrieval accuracy: Did the system find the right documents, facts, or evidence?
- Semantic similarity: Does the AI output mean the same thing as the correct reference, even if the words differ?
- LLM-as-judge: Use another model to rate clarity, helpfulness, and soundness of reasoning.
- Bias detection: Check if errors affect one group more than others.
- Hallucination rate: How often does the agent make things up?
- Calibration error: Does the agent’s confidence level match its actual correctness?

𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲

It’s not enough to measure results at the end. Every step in the workflow should be monitored and verified.

For eg, if an agent is retrieving data for a compliance check, we need to know:

- Which sources it used
- Whether its confidence was justified
- If it skipped or misread any step

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲

Building agents from scratch for every new workflow is inefficient. A better way is to create a central library of reusable services and assets, such as:

- Pre-approved prompts
- Application patterns
- Reusable code snippets
- Observability tools for LLMs
- Training materials

𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹

Even with advanced agents, humans will always be part of the picture. Their role, however, will evolve.

Instead of doing repetitive tasks, humans will supervise, guide, and collaborate with agents. One promising area is human–agent collaborative design, which creates simple interfaces so that non-technical people can interact with AI systems easily.

One that never sleeps, checks every reply, and tells you—in plain English—if it’s good or not.

That’s “LLM-as-a-judge.” One AI grading another, on your rules.

Example: a support bot gets a new “concise and friendly” voice. Instead of reading 2,000 replies, you ask LLM to be “support manager for a day.”

The prompt:
“You are a senior CX lead. Rate this reply 1–5 for conciseness and empathy. Return only: {score} | {one-sentence reason}.”

Boom. 87% of answers score 4 or higher. The weak 13%? Refund questions. That’s where you add humans.

Result: you ship faster, learn sooner, and let people focus on the tricky cases.

If your QA plan still says, “we’ll spot-check 50 samples,” maybe it’s time to appoint an AI judge.

Researchers studied three groups inside an organization, all asked to write web articles:
 • Insiders: SEO web analysts who regularly wrote articles
 • Adjacent outsiders: marketers in the same department who didn’t usually write
 • Distant outsiders: technologists whose work was unrelated to writing 

AI didn’t boost every group equally. It helped adjacent outsiders close the gap and perform at insider level. But distant outsiders (technologists) still fell short. Even with AI fine-tuned on company documents, their articles scored lower than insiders’. They hit what the researchers call the “GenAI wall.” 

They lacked too much of the marketers’ tacit knowledge: the instinct for tone, the craft of building a narrative, the ability to weave ideas coherently, and the judgment of what makes an article “good.” AI couldn’t fill that gap or replicate the intuition that insiders had built through experience.

One of the next big challenges, and opportunities, for AI is learning tacit knowledge. Bridging the gap between novices and experts requires more than data. It means capturing the shortcuts, sequences, and judgment calls that turn a draft into a finished product. 

Only when AI understands the real workflows, rhythms, and processes of an organization can it start to absorb that hidden know-how—and begin to shift the “GenAI wall.”",Text,266,33,19,1mo,Vaibhav Goyal reposted this,Arvind Jain,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jain-arvind,https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhavg/,2025-09-22T11:25:00.000Z,,2025-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-09-22

Recently, I pulled out some really old family photos.
Faded, scratched, almost torn.
The kind of memories you’re scared to even touch.

I decided to try Google Gemini / Veo to restore and animate them.

At first, it wasn’t perfect.
Faces looked blurry, eyes came out strange, and the colors felt too modern.
But with some trial and error—and the right prompts—things started to change.

Here’s what worked for me:
“Restore old black and white photo, remove scratches, sharpen face details, natural skin tones.”
“Animate portrait — subtle eye blink, gentle smile, natural head movement, realistic lighting.”

And suddenly… that grainy picture of my parents turned sharp, clear, and alive.
When the animation played—eyes blinking, lips moving softly—it felt like time was breathing again.
Honestly, it gave me goosebumps.

Three years ago, two journeys began almost at the same time — the birth of my son and the birth of my personal brand.

The first step as parents was naming. My wife and I wanted our son’s name to reflect our values. That clarity made the decision quick. I realise now — conceptualising my brand was the same. Identity comes first and it needs to stem from your deep vision.

Soon, my son started crawling, then walking. Every day was a baby step forward. Some falls, some wins. That’s how a personal brand grows too — small, steady efforts like writing one post, connecting with one person, sharing one idea.

Next came the exploring phase. He began noticing and engaging with things on his own. Some guidance helped, but most of the learning came naturally. My brand also grew this way — not only from planning but also from experiments and surprises.

Then he began running. Chasing what he liked, leaving what he didn’t. I’ve learned to do the same — focusing on work that feels right and letting go of what doesn’t.

Finally came speaking. At first, he repeated words like a parrot. Slowly, his own voice came out. For any brand, this is the most important stage too — moving from copying others to finding your own voice.

Today, as I see my son turning 3, I see my journey reflected in his. 
Growth — whether of a child or a brand — is never instant. It’s made of small steps, curiosity, focus, and finally, a voice that is truly yours.

 •	Substance in answers
 •	Eye contact & body language

2. STAR method works
 •	Situation
 •	Task
 •	Action
 •	Result
Example (tech): Fixed payment bug in 5 mins during peak traffic.

3. Keywords without stuffing
“I used SEO & analytics to grow traffic by 60% in 4 months.”
and not “I’m great at SEO, marketing, analytics.”

4. Practise your vocal smile
Yes — AI “hears” warmth.
Talk like you’re speaking to a friendly teammate.

5. Look at the lens, not your reflection.

6. If you get a surprise question?
Smile, pause, and say:
“That’s a great question — let me think for a sec.”

7. Balance warmth and precision

8. Be specific with results
“Cut load time from 4s to 1.2s, saving 25% server costs.”
and not “Improved system performance”

I was working and deeply entrenched in content tech industry after building and launching several products for multiple companies. I don't know why but I wanted to work in AI (btw, I worked on a couple of projects in Neural networks when was in IIT). Also having worked in mid to large companies, my calling was to work in startups. I was keen and determined to change myself. 

I picked up several new technical skills while exploring opportunities. I spoke to a few people who were working in AI. Luckily, I found an AI startup which was in convergence space of content and AI. I pitched and was lucky that I got a good role balancing my aspirations to learn and also lead a team. It was not an easy decision. The whole challenge was to start delivering in the new environment. First 3 months were really hard. 

When I reflect back and see, I always feel that this was the best career decision I took. 

For those of you who are considering career pivots

- What kind of job/change you are looking for? Narrow down your career choices/roles (don't just go with trends and what others are opting)
- Prepare your mind for the new challenges (very very important)
- Connect and speak to people who are into similar jobs
- Identify skill gaps and make an actionable transformation plan 
- Do side hustles if needed to gain skills
- Consider taking a break from your existing job if you are financially sound
- Join a structured program (as needed)
- Share your work with people who can give you right feedback 
- Apply for jobs regularly and evaluate your preparedness
- Take a leap of faith and jump (no easy option)

- Always carry a pen/paper or laptop in every meeting and take notes
- Pen down your thoughts when they come
- Follow good writers in your area of interest
- Pick up your favorite topic and start with freestyle writing
- Openly share your views and build your unique voice online
- Read a lot of books, mark important points and share them
- Use AI wisely to correct your sentences, find new words, polish your thoughts

To do structured writing - jot down your ideas as pointers. build a flow, make  drafts, read and do self review. update and refine.

Most companies optimize for speed in simple transactions while fumbling the conversations that actually drive revenue. It's like perfecting your small talk while failing every job interview.

Utility Conversations: This governs the simple stuff: reminders, updates, confirmations. Here, brevity is king. Users want information, not intimacy. Get in, deliver value, get out. No small talk required.

Free Flowing Conversations: This operates in the realm of pure relationship. These are the conversations that serve no transactional purpose but fulfill a deeper human need-the digital equivalent of sitting on a porch, sharing silence with someone you trust. This is where AI companions, therapy bots, and digital astrologers live. The goal isn't efficiency; it's presence.

Persuasive Conversations: This sits in the profitable middle ground between Utility and Free Flowing. This is where the real money lives - every conversation that requires changing minds rather than simply providing information. Loan collections, insurance sales, complex purchases, understanding why someone abandoned their shopping cart. They require something more sophisticated: the ability to build just enough trust to accomplish a specific goal, then gracefully exit.

1. Keep tasks small and clear
 •	Break down big goals into simple, sequential steps.
 •	LLMs perform best when each task is focused and can be completed in approximately 10–15 minutes.

2. Rely on one smart agent
 •	Avoid overengineering with multiple agents and complex inter-agent communication.
 •	Equip a single agent with long context and tools so it can work end-to-end.

3. Double-check outputs
 •	Implement a verification step after each task.
 •	Ask agents to check their own work or specify criteria for success or failure, to catch errors early.

4. Remind the agent of its goal
 •	Reinforce the end goal repeatedly, especially in long workflows.
 •	Summarize progress and clarify what remains to be done at each step.

5. Provide tools 
 •	Let your agent read and write files, take notes, and track progress.
 •	Treat giving tools as “adding memory”—this enables agents to maintain continuity and avoid forgetting earlier steps.

6. Never change context in midway (for multi-turn agents)
 •	Keeping a linear, append-only log is simpler, more transparent, and reduces errors.

Why JSON? Because newer AI video tools like Veo3, Sora, and Runway work better when they get well-organized prompts like that. This kind of converter could make it way easier for people to create high-quality videos without needing to be super technical.

- Try improv: It helps you stay calm, think quickly, and handle the unexpected. Plus, it’s fun!
- Pick people-focused roles: AI can’t build trust, show care, or read emotions. Jobs like coaching, counselling, or community work still need real people.

It’s not the answers that make a agent feel human.
It’s everything between the answers.

It’s about rhythm, timing, and subtle social signals we humans take for granted.

Here’s where most voice agents still fall short:

Can it sense when you’re done speaking — or does it jump the gun and interrupt?
Can it gracefully pause, overlap, or let you finish a sentence without sounding mechanical?
Humans typically respond in ~200 ms. Agents often take seconds… or worse, talk over you.
A 2-second silence can mean respect in one culture, awkwardness in another. Most systems don’t account for that.

Until agents master the unspoken parts of conversation,
they’ll keep sounding like guests at a party who don’t know when to speak — or when to leave.

A few years ago, every second pitch deck had the same formula:
US-first SaaS,  PLG motion & We’ll cross $1M ARR in 14 months

Fast forward to 2025, and something has seriously shifted.

Today, VCs I talk to don’t ask, “What’s your ACV?”
They ask, “How native is your AI stack?”

And I get it. The data is loud and clear.
From Jan to June this year, AI-native startups in India raised $454M across 65 deals.
SaaS startups? $432M across 52 deals.
First time AI has pulled ahead.

Not by much—but it’s the direction that matters.

So what’s going on?

It’s not that SaaS is going away.
It’s that AI-first products are showing more velocity, more depth, and more promise.

And I’m not talking about “we added an AI assistant” kind of stuff.
I mean startups that are built with AI at the core—where the product actually gets better the more people use it.

We’ve felt this shift ourselves.

When we started, our platform was a tool to manage borrower outreach.
Today, it’s evolved into a full-stack agentic AI platform for debt collection—running multilingual voice and WhatsApp campaigns powered by speech, language, and reasoning models.

Our AI agents negotiate repayments in real-time, adapt to borrower sentiment, and learn from every call.
We support financial products from personal loans to gold loans, across India’s complex linguistic and behavioral landscape.

Same problem: collections.
Totally new solution: conversational AI that actually gets results.

𝐈𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐨𝐧.

Had a candid chat recently with a VC friend. His exact words:

“We’re not backing SaaS unless it’s got a serious AI angle now. It’s just too hard to defend otherwise.”

That’s echoed by folks at Accel, Stellaris, Inflection Point—they’re all saying the same thing.
More than 80% of new SaaS deal flow is AI-led.

Why?

Because AI-native products:
✅ Have real moats (your data = your advantage)
✅ Scale faster (less human ops)
✅ Solve problems in new ways, not just faster ones

Valuations are showing it too. Many AI-native startups are getting 3–4x the multiple of similar SaaS counterparts.


The SaaS wave gave us unicorns.
The AI-native wave might just give us giants.

If you’re building something new—don’t bolt AI onto your roadmap.
Start from first principles.

What would your product look like if AI was the starting point?

Chances are, it won’t look anything like your old one.

Let’s build that future.
Let’s build AI-native.

Features like intelligent cameras and voice assistants—once exclusive to expensive flagship devices—are now making their way into affordable smartphones. This transformation is being driven by smaller brands leveraging a new wave of low-cost, AI-capable chipsets.

Chipmakers are at the heart of this revolution, holding the key to reducing the cost of processing AI tasks. The iQOO Neo 10R, powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3, has dominated the mid-range segment since its April 2025 launch, delivering stellar gaming, multitasking, and AI-enhanced performance. Meanwhile, the Vivo T4X, priced under ₹15,000, introduces AI capabilities to budget-conscious buyers with its MediaTek Dimensity 7300 chipset.

So, what’s driving this democratization of AI?

First, Neural Processing Units (NPUs) like MediaTek’s NPU 655 in the Dimensity 7300 double the efficiency of AI tasks, enabling on-device processing for seamless, cloud-independent experiences.

Second, efficient fabrication processes—such as the 4nm technology used in Qualcomm and MediaTek chipsets—pack more power into smaller, energy-efficient designs, making AI viable at lower price points.

Third, optimized open-source AI models tailored for mobile—like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 supporting Meta’s Llama 3.2—allow mid-tier phones to run sophisticated AI applications locally, enhancing both privacy and performance.

As smaller brands continue to adopt these affordable, AI-capable chipsets, the market is rapidly evolving. IDC predicts that 28% of new smartphones will be generative AI-capable by the end of 2025, rising to 58% by 2028. This trend not only fuels innovation but also empowers consumers with AI-driven features—such as smarter photography, real-time translation, and personalized assistants—without breaking the bank.

The future of mobile technology is inclusive, and it’s exciting to see how these advancements will reshape our digital lives.

AI has grown by learning from human footprints — our texts, images, conversations.
But that curve is flattening. You can only remix the past for so long.

True breakthroughs — new theorems, new sciences — live outside existing knowledge.
They won’t be found by scraping more data.
They’ll come from AI learning like humans truly learn: through experience.

In the next era, AI agents will:

- Move through continuous streams of experience — not static snapshots.
- Engage deeply with environments — not just human prompts.
- Ground rewards in real outcomes — not labels.
- Reason from lived experience — not mimicry.

Example:
Imagine an AI scientist that doesn’t just study papers but runs its own experiments, sees patterns we missed, and invents theories — not because we programmed it, but because it discovered them.

“Arrange seating for a wedding dinner, considering traditions, photogenic angles, and feuding family members.”

Traditional Language Model (Llama 3)
- Generated a seating plan in <500 tokens (result was fast)
- Produced errors due to insufficient reasoning about complex constraints
- Failed to account for nuanced family dynamics and photogenic requirements

Reasoning Model (Deepseek R1)
- Used >8,000 tokens for multi-step analysis
- Identified family conflicts through relationship mapping
- Optimized seating angles for photography sightlines
- Balanced traditional seating protocols with modern preferences
- Performed iterative validation checks on proposed arrangements

Look at this example

AI: “Marie Curie was a physicist.”

User: “What did she discover?”
AI: “Can you specify which person you are referring to?” (without chat completion)

I feel this recent growth is driven by multiple factors coming together—strong market expansion, wider reach beyond big cities, better digital infrastructure, tech innovation, a young population, changing investor focus, and supportive government policies.

Investors are betting big on the sector as fintech expands beyond metros into Tier II and III cities.

Who’s getting funded?
• Payments & Lending lead the way – Digital payment startups (ToneTag, Cashfree, HiWiPay, Dodo) and lending-focused fintechs (Infinity Fincorp, Oxyzo, Eduvanz, Bizloan) saw major inflows.
• Wealth management & finance startups (Waterfield, ArthAlpha, GrayQuest) also gained investor interest.
• Early-stage funding is strong, signaling confidence in new fintech ventures, while larger Series A/B rounds and even debt financing fuel growth-stage startups.

With India on track to becoming a global fintech hub, this funding surge reflects long-term investor confidence, not just a short-term trend. Low equity penetration and untapped markets beyond urban centers make fintech one of the most promising sectors for sustained growth.

My wing mates are still some of my closest friends, forming a strong network that has lasted a lifetime.

At IIT, life was simple but full of learning. Some of the greatest professors in the country would ride cycles, eat in the same canteen as us, and share stories over a cup of chai. Their humility and wisdom left a lasting impact on me.

Proud to be part of the Naukri Campus Scholarship, dedicated to supporting and empowering India’s top engineering talent through scholarships and recognition. With ₹24 Lakhs in main scholarships, ₹39 Lakhs in mini college-level scholarships, and full semester fee coverage for 16 national winners, it opens doors for bright minds. The initiative is open to students from IIT, NIT, IIIT, and BITS, with 264 campus-level winners.

Life at IIT was all about solving problems—workshops, assignments, projects, and all-nighters. But beyond academics, I learned how to think, adapt, and never give up. That mindset has shaped my journey ever since.

Engineering will challenge you every day, but the key is to stay curious, keep solving, and never stop learning. A sharp mind and a never-give-up attitude will take you far!

I believe that AI will make us even more human.

Socrates, the Greek philosopher is famous for saying that wisdom comes from realizing how little we know,

or that progress can only be made by asking better questions.

The Socratic method is essentially the practice of relentless questioning. Relentless questioning is something academics do all the time.

It has been core to the progress of human intellect over the past 1,000 years.

Relentless questioning is also a practice that can be done orders of magnitude better with the power of AI.

The physicist David Deutsch has proposed that we humans are the only species who have curiosity for what is already familiar.

We can know so much about the stars above us or the machines in front of us and yet continue to have more questions about them.

It seems like for humans, every answer leads to a new set of questions. Questions that we haven't even asked before.

AI models, even ""open weight"" models like Deepseek are black boxes. 

There are two big unknowns: We do not know what kind of training data went into them and second, we do not know what kind of ""reinforcement learning"" was done to make them ""behave well"". 

Here ""behave well"" includes innocuous things like making the model polite to human users and much more contentious issues like active censorship of ideas the model trainer wants to suppress.

The models reflect the values systems of those that train them.

US trained models show sensitivity in certain areas while Chinese trained models show in other areas. 

In areas like generating code to playing chess, there are objective standards by which we can evaluate models (even here, to give an example, a model could prefer Javascript over C but that is a second order issue). 

This is why I would trust these models only when there are other objective ways to evaluate their output. This is true for fields like programming, computer aided design etc.

I would not trust the AI to give economic development advice - given that I don't find most academic economics useful and these models have memorized the text books and the value-neutral economics they teach. But that is own my bias.

When we deeply reflect on this, we can see that the ultimate model is going to differ from person to person, and that personal model will train itself on the person's own system of values, acting as a faithful mirror of their thinking process.",Text,12,0,0,8mo,Post,Vaibhav Goyal,https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhavg,https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhavg/,2025-02-24T11:31:00.000Z,,2025-02-05T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-02-24

AI is not hard 
————————————
Many teams that built foundation models are below 50 ppl (e.g. Mixtral). 
In AI, LLM science part is actually quite easy. 
All these models are “Transformer Decoder only models”, an architecture that was invented in late 2017. 
There are improvements since then (flash attention, ROPE, MOE, PPO/DPO/GRPO), but they are relatively minor, open source and easy to implement. 

Since building foundation models is easy and Nvidia is there to help you (if not directly, then by sharing their software like “Megatron” that is assembly line to build AI models) there are so many foundation models built by Chinese labs as well as global labs.

It is machines that learn by themselves…if you give them data & compute. This is unlike writing operating system or database software. Also, everyone trains on same data: internet archives, books, github code for the first stage called “pre-training”.

What is part is hard then?
———————————-
It is the parallel & distributed computing to run AI training jobs across thousands of GPUs that is hard. DeepSeek did lot of innovation here to save on “flops” and network calls. They used an innovative architecture called Mixture of Experts and a new approach called GRPO. with verifiable rewards both of which are in open domain through 2024.

Also, there is lot of data curation needed particularly for “post training”
to teach model on proper style of answering (SFT/DPO) or to teach them learn to reason (GRPO with verifiable reward). SFT/DPO is where “stealing” from existing models to save cost of manual labor may happen.

LLM building is nothing that Indian engineers living in India cannot pull off. Don’t worry about Indians who have left. There are plenty in the country as of today. 

Then why India does not have foundation models?
———————
It is for the same reason India does not have Google or Facebook of its own. 

You need to able to walk before you can run.

There is no protected market to practice your craft in early days. You will get replaced by American service providers as they are cheaper and better every single time. That is not the case with Chinese player. They have a protected market and leadership who treats this skillset as existential due to geopolitics. 

So, even if Chinese models are not good in early days they will continue to get funding from their conglomerates as well as provincial governments. Darwinian competition ensures best rise to the top.

Recall DeepSeek took 2 years to get here without much revenue. They were funded by their parent. Also, most of their engineers are not PHDs.

There is nothing that engineers who built Ola/Swiggy/Flipkart cannot build. Remember these services are second to none when you compare them to their Bay Area counterparts. Also , don’t trivialize those services; there is brilliant engineering to make them work at the price points at which they work.",Text,19,5,0,8mo,Post,Vaibhav Goyal,https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhavg,https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhavg/,2025-02-24T11:31:00.000Z,,2025-01-29T00:00:00.000Z,,,2025-02-24

Success in AI isn’t just about developing powerful applications; it’s about creating models and the entire ecosystem that ensures self-reliance and global competitiveness.

China’s DeepSeek V3, with 671 billion parameters, demonstrates the transformative potential of efficient innovation. Surpassing global benchmarks in text understanding, coding, and problem-solving, it was developed at a remarkably low cost of $5.58 million—showcasing the impact of strategic, resource-conscious execution.

India has a history of achieving world-class outcomes on shoestring budgets. The Chandrayaan-3 mission, for instance, cost just $71 million—1/25th of Russia’s lunar mission and less than half the budget of the Hollywood movie Interstellar.

To establish AI sovereignty and global leadership, India must channel this same ingenuity and urgency into developing entire AI ecosystem here.

✅ Standard (60-80%): For compliance, accuracy, and consistency. Think legal disclosures, account details, and FAQs.
🤖 Generated (20-40%): For empathy, personalization, and dynamic problem-solving. Perfect for offering flexible options or answering unstructured queries.

Example:
• Standard: “Your payment is overdue by 10 days.”
• Generated: “Would you like help setting up a payment plan to resolve this?”

In regulated industries, lean on standard responses. For user-centric applications, add dynamic interactions to boost engagement. The right blend creates a bot that’s both compliant and humanized. 💡

1. Prompt matters - a lot 
Effective prompt engineering requires collaboration between domain experts and technical teams, treating it as an iterative, artistic process rather than a rigid scientific approach.

2. Be vigilant about data curation 
Not all organizational data is equally valuable; strategic data selection is crucial for controlling costs and maximizing the quality of generative AI outputs.

3. Invest in an orchestration layer 
A sophisticated routing mechanism can help overcome LLM limitations by intelligently selecting the most appropriate model for specific tasks, improving both performance and cost-efficiency.

4. Test and test again - and again 
Proactive testing with active learning loops is essential in generative AI development, allowing quick detection and correction of potential issues like model hallucinations or misunderstood intents.

5. It's never just tech 
Successful AI adoption requires a holistic approach that goes beyond technology, focusing on user experience, continuous learning, leadership engagement, and adaptive support mechanisms.

This is the promise of voice-enabled LLM agents, a technological leap that's redefining how we interact with machines.

Traditional text-based chatbots are like trying to dance with two left feet. They're clunky, impersonal, and frustratingly limited. Consider these real-world friction points:
- A visually impaired user struggling to type support queries
- A fitness enthusiast unable to get real-time guidance mid-workout
- A busy professional multitasking who can't pause to type a complex question

Voice AI breaks these barriers, mimicking how humans have communicated for millennia. We learn to speak by four months, but writing takes years - testament to speech's fundamental naturalness.

Real-World Transformation Examples:
1️⃣ Healthcare: Emotion-recognizing AI can detect patient stress levels through voice modulation, enabling more empathetic remote consultations.
2️⃣ Fitness: Hands-free coaching that adapts workout intensity based on your breathing and vocal energy.
3️⃣ Customer Service: Intelligent voice systems that understand context, emotional undertones, and personalize responses in real-time.

The magic of voice lies in its nuanced communication:
- Tone reveals emotional landscapes
- Intensity signals urgency or excitement
- Rhythm creates conversational flow
- Inflection adds layers of meaning beyond mere words
- Recognize emotional states with unprecedented accuracy
- Support rich, multimodal interactions combining voice, visuals, and context
- Differentiate speakers in complex conversations
- Extract subtle contextual intentions
- Provide personalized responses based on voice characteristics

In short, this technology is about creating more human-centric technology that listens, understands, and responds like a thoughtful companion.
