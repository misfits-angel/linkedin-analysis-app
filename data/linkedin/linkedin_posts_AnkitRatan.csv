The Fintech Premier League is here.

For the last few months, we‚Äôve been working on building something truly exciting, and today, it‚Äôs finally live! ‚ö°Ô∏è

Introducing the Fintech Premier League (FPL) - a first-of-its-kind CXO cricket league bringing together 32 of India‚Äôs leading fintechs on one field to celebrate collaboration, competition, and camaraderie.

This has been one of the most fun and meaningful projects I‚Äôve worked on, seeing founders, CXOs, and teams from across the ecosystem come together not just to play but to connect and build lasting relationships beyond business.

FPL will be played across NCR, Mumbai, and Bangalore, with regional rounds, finals, and a national championship that promises to be as dynamic and spirited as the fintech ecosystem itself.

üèè Here‚Äôs to strategy, teamwork, and a healthy dose of rivalry, all in the name of community and sport.
Couldn‚Äôt be more thrilled to officially launch the season alongside all 32 incredible team captains!

üí¨ If you‚Äôre curious about the league, partnerships, or want to be part of the action ‚Äî reach out to me. The Fintech Premier League has just begun, and trust me, it‚Äôs going to be unforgettable.

I‚Äôve been reviewing a lot of PRDs recently, and I‚Äôve noticed something worrying.
Some product managers are now using GPT to drive their thinking instead of support it.
The result? Documents that check every box of a PRD template‚Ä¶ but are full of confusion. To a junior PM, it looks polished. To an experienced eye, it‚Äôs mostly noise.

To be clear: GPT is extremely powerful. We use it daily. But like any power tool, the outcome depends on the craftsperson. When GPT leads, it can produce confident structure without correct substance‚Äîand that‚Äôs hard to detect if you‚Äôre early in your career.

Where GPT shines
-Evidence gathering: pull prior art, benchmarks, and user quotes.
-Synthesis: compress interviews/notes into themes and edge cases.
-Exploration: generate alternative framings, risks, and test scenarios.
-Communication: first drafts of release notes, FAQs, checklists.

What you should not outsource
-Problem definition: who is the user, what‚Äôs the job, what hurts now.
-Context + constraints: compliance, data realities, org priorities.
-Prioritization and trade-offs: what we will not build and why.
Decision ownership: success metrics, guardrails, and accountability.

A simple review test I use
Few sentence problem (no AI): if you can‚Äôt state it cleanly, you‚Äôre not ready to draft.
Evidence trace: every user scenario ties to a source or observation.
Decisions > templates: I look for rationale, not headings.

GPT should amplify your clarity, not simulate it. If the first time you feel ‚Äúclear‚Äù is after the AI draft, that‚Äôs a warning sign.
To young professionals (PMs and beyond): master the thinking, then use GPT to accelerate it. Tools compound good judgment; they can‚Äôt replace it.

But there‚Äôs another side to my life ‚Äî much quieter, but just as meaningful.
For the past few years, my family ( Moni Gupta, Aloka Kumar Kulshrestha) has been running an initiative called Seva Setu. It‚Äôs not a startup. There‚Äôs no pitch deck. No VC funding. Just a simple mission: serve those who are often overlooked ‚Äî children from underserved communities, the elderly in care homes, even animals in need.
This past year, Seva Setu has supported students with study kits, helped children access daily nutritious meals, enabled access to quality education, cared for elders, and looked after cows in gaushalas.
It‚Äôs not loud work, but worth it.
Whenever the intensity of building Signzy feels overwhelming, Seva Setu reminds me of a different kind of impact - one measured not in product metrics or scale, but in human moments. 
We‚Äôve put together a short annual report to capture some of what we‚Äôve been able to do this year. If you‚Äôd like to take a look or just know more, here it is: Seva_Setu_Annual_Report_2024-25

Turns out, even when you check all the compliance boxes, users can still drop off‚Äîespecially when verification flows don‚Äôt flex.

 ‚Ä¢ Data pre-fill (telco + alternate)
 ‚Ä¢ One-touch doc-based KYC with biometrics
You can mix and match‚Äîgo docless, or hybrid, or a smart 2x2 setup.
Want to add AML? IP signals? Risk scoring on email or phone? It's all doable.

A recent debate has reignited this foundational AI question.

It started with an Apple research paper that argued today‚Äôs AI systems‚Äîincluding large language models‚Äîare not truly ‚Äúreasoning.‚Äù They‚Äôre just doing statistical pattern matching at scale. No abstraction, no understanding, no causality‚Äîjust very good autocomplete.

In response, Ilya Sutskever (co-founder of OpenAI) delivered a lecture where he flipped the script:

> ‚ÄúOur brains are also just giant pattern matchers.‚Äù



His point? Intelligence doesn‚Äôt require symbolic logic or explicit reasoning steps. The human brain learns from patterns too‚Äîassociations, reinforcement, feedback. And LLMs are perhaps walking the same evolutionary path, just digitally.

But here‚Äôs a missing piece that neither side emphasizes enough:
The substrate matters.

üß† Human brains are massively parallel, analog, and energy efficient. Neurons can fire with infinite gradations, and billions of them operate simultaneously. Pattern matching in the brain can involve emotional nuance, parallel thoughts, and contextual awareness‚Äîall happening together.

üíª AI systems, on the other hand, run on silicon chips. Even with GPUs and TPUs, they‚Äôre fundamentally linear, digital, and binary. A transistor can be ON or OFF. Parallelism is simulated, and multitasking is expensive. When an LLM generates a sentence, it's not juggling multiple perspectives in the way a human does‚Äîit‚Äôs walking one path at a time, very fast.

So yes, maybe both brains and LLMs are pattern matchers.
But only one of them is doing it in wetware, with organic nuance and infinite resolution. The other is stuck in silicon.

And perhaps, that difference still matters more than we think.",38,2,0,4mo,Post,Ankit Ratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan/,2025-06-25T16:32:00.000Z,,2025-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,,2025-06-25

Spoke more about this in my recent article for Elets Banking and Finance  (linked in the first comment)
Two pivotal points that jumped out:
-Ten years ago, a cross-border onboarding flow took days and a war room of analysts. Today, a well-trained model can clear a customer in under five minutes and still spot the deepfake hiding behind a doctored passport photo.
-Also, this shift isn‚Äôt only about speed; it‚Äôs about who gets to build. When rules can be codified and updated in software, compliance moves from a cost centre to a product feature. Suddenly regional banks, credit unions, even niche fintech apps can launch globally without blowing up their risk budget.

EPAA‚Äôs report does a great job capturing the momentum in India‚Äôs digital payments landscape‚Äînot just trends, but the real energy shaping the future.

I had the chance to share a small perspective on something I care deeply about: how trust, compliance, and regtech are evolving in our region. As payments become faster and more seamless, the invisible infrastructure of identity and fraud prevention becomes even more important.

At Signzy, we‚Äôve been quietly working behind the scenes to build that infrastructure‚Äîhelping banks and fintechs onboard customers with trust, speed, and security. It‚Äôs encouraging to see these conversations gaining more attention.

Thank you to Monica Jasuja and Camilla Bullock at EPA for the thoughtful dialogue and for including Signzy as one of the voices from India.

A few striking numbers from the report:

Digital payment transaction volumes have grown 573x between 2005 and 2024.

The number of banks live on UPI has grown from 21 in 2016 to 661 in 2025.

UPI transaction value has soared from ‚Çπ69.53 billion in 2016‚Äì17 to a projected ‚Çπ275 trillion in 2024‚Äì25.

There‚Äôs a lot of buzz around new AI frameworks like MCP and A2A, and many people are asking ‚Äî how are these different from traditional APIs?

Let‚Äôs break it down with simple examples:
1. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
 APIs are how different apps talk to each other ‚Äî especially when they‚Äôre owned by different teams or companies.
Example:
 Your app wants to check the credit score of a user. You hit an external credit bureau‚Äôs API, which returns a score.
 The bureau decides what data to expose, how often, and in what format.
APIs are great for external world integration ‚Äî clean, secure, versioned. But they require agreement, documentation, and often strict access control.
 You don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs behind the curtain ‚Äî you just use what‚Äôs offered.

2. MCP (Model-Context Protocol)
 Introduced by Anthropic, MCP allows LLMs to interact with external tools and data via a standardized interface. It‚Äôs still a one-model world, but you feed it structured access to plugins and databases.
Example:
 An LLM helping a customer support agent might use MCP to look up order history, check return status, or send a refund ‚Äî all through tools connected via this common protocol.
MCP is about making a single AI model smarter by giving it controlled access to context and tools.
 It reduces the need to hard-code every integration.

3. A2A (Agent-to-Agent Framework)
 This is where things shift from integration to collaboration. With A2A, different AI agents can talk to each other, negotiate, and complete tasks together ‚Äî even across systems ‚Äî without needing formal APIs exposed.
Example:
A lightweight agent on your app checks user inputs
It passes the data to a document-verifying agent
That agent flags inconsistencies and triggers a risk-check agent
All this happens internally, without each system exposing APIs or standardizing requests
It‚Äôs like RPA ‚Äî but no humans in the loop, and far more intelligence.

The Big Shift
API: You tell me what you expose, and I‚Äôll write code to use it.
MCP: I‚Äôm one smart AI, and I know how to use tools if you give me handles.
A2A: I‚Äôm part of a team of smart agents. We‚Äôll talk, figure it out, and get the job done ‚Äî no need to call IT to expose a new API.

This opens up exciting new possibilities:
-Teams don‚Äôt have to standardize every backend operation into an API
-On-device agents can handle more on the edge
-Internal workflows become more autonomous and scalable

The AI architecture of the future won‚Äôt be a single genius model ‚Äî it‚Äôll be a team of capable agents talking to each other.
Let me know what you think ‚Äî or if you‚Äôve started playing with these ideas. Would love to hear more use cases.",117,20,5,6mo,Post,Ankit Ratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan/,2025-04-26T16:32:00.000Z,,2025-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,,2025-04-26

It‚Äôs a framework where different AI agents can talk to each other, work together, and check each other‚Äôs work.
Instead of one big model doing everything, A2A lets multiple smaller agents handle different tasks ‚Äî like writing code, reviewing it, and deciding what to do next. Kind of like how real teams operate.
What‚Äôs exciting here is that this is not just about breaking one prompt into parts (like MCP does). In MCP, you're still driving one model to do multiple tasks in a structured way ‚Äî like giving it a checklist. But with A2A, you're creating actual independent agents, each focused on their own specialty, talking and collaborating like co-workers. It‚Äôs a more modular, flexible setup.
Another interesting angle: A2A could enable lightweight agents on the edge (like inside your mobile app) to talk to more powerful agents running on the backend. That could mean faster responses, less data transfer, and better privacy ‚Äî especially useful in customer-facing apps.
In the customer onboarding space, this opens up a lot. You often need:
One agent to recommend the right financial product
Another to verify documents and extract data
A third to assess customer risk
With A2A, these specialized agents can be trained once and reused across different workflows ‚Äî no need to build new agents or clunky rule-switching logic every time something changes.
We‚Äôre exploring how this could help improve our own onboarding and document automation flows. Early days, but it feels like a solid step toward building smarter, more adaptable AI systems.",113,9,2,6mo,Post,Ankit Ratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan/,2025-04-26T16:32:00.000Z,,2025-04-10T00:00:00.000Z,,2025-04-26
https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7313922402642546688,Text,,,"Beyond Fancy Ice Creams: A Wake-Up Call for India‚Äôs Innovation Ecosystem

Union Minister Piyush Goyal recent remarks at Startup Mahakumbh‚Äîmentioning ‚Äúfancy ice creams‚Äù and ‚Äúhyperfast groceries‚Äù‚Äîsparked strong reactions across India‚Äôs startup world.

But perhaps the criticism should be seen less as dismissal and more as deliberate tough love. Goyal, one of India‚Äôs most effective communicators, likely chose his words to provoke reflection‚Äînot discourage innovation. Like a parent urging a child to aim higher, his message is clear: India must prioritize deep tech innovation if it wants to lead globally.

While consumption-driven startups have created jobs, attracted FDI, and modernized services, they often reorganize existing spending patterns rather than build long-term capability. True nation-changing innovation‚Äîsemiconductors, robotics, EVs, AI‚Äîrequires patient investment, research, and ecosystem-wide support.

Countries like South Korea (electronics), Israel (cybersecurity), and China (EVs & automation) made deliberate, long-term bets on deep tech‚Äîand are reaping the benefits.

The responsibility doesn‚Äôt lie with founders alone. Government, academia, investors, and corporate leaders must work in concert. That means more public funding for research, deeper academia-industry collaboration, and a culture that celebrates solving hard problems‚Äînot just scaling fast.

India doesn‚Äôt need to abandon consumer innovation. But we must balance it with bold, future-defining bets. The next chapter of our startup story should be about building the technology the world uses‚Äînot just delivering it faster.

If this speech makes us pause and ask: What kind of innovation will define India in 2047?, then it has served its purpose.

Let‚Äôs celebrate our progress‚Äîbut also raise our ambitions.",71,8,1,6mo,Post,Ankit Ratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitratan/,2025-04-26T16:32:00.000Z,,2025-04-04T00:00:00.000Z,,2025-04-26

Remember the days when splitting a bill meant long calculations, awkward reminders, and the dreaded ""I'll pay you later"" texts? Apps like Splitwise thrived because paying back was a pain‚Äîlogging into a bank on a desktop, adding payees, and waiting for transfers to process.
Then came UPI in India‚Äîand overnight, bill-splitting apps became almost‚Ä¶ irrelevant. üíÄ
üìä UPI Revolution in Numbers:
 ‚úÖ 8.9 billion transactions in April 2024 üöÄ
 ‚úÖ 85%+ market share dominated by PhonePe & Google Pay
 ‚úÖ Instant, 24/7 transfers with no need for third-party apps
Now, you just scan, pay, and move on‚Äîno need to ""split later"" when you can pay instantly. Apps like PhonePe and Google Pay even offer built-in bill-splitting features.
Meanwhile, in the US‚Ä¶ üá∫üá∏
 Without a widely adopted real-time payment system like UPI, apps like Splitwise, Venmo, and SettleUp still thrive. People track expenses, send Venmo requests, and wait for money to land in their bank accounts.
üí° Lesson?
 Tech adoption isn‚Äôt just about innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs about removing friction. India leapfrogged the bill-splitting era by making payments instant, while the US still leans on dedicated apps.

For 90 years, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has done just that. Quietly shaping the way India banks, transacts, and trusts its financial system.

From coins in our pockets to the tap of a phone, the RBI‚Äôs journey is stitched into the fabric of our daily lives.

As we continue celebrating #RBIWeek at Signzy, today‚Äôs spotlight is on the milestones that made this institution a force of stability, innovation, and progress ‚Äî one policy at a time.

Whether it was introducing Asia‚Äôs first deposit insurance to protect small depositors, driving credit towards agriculture and small businesses through priority sector lending, or nationalizing banks to make financial services accessible to millions ‚Äî each milestone shaped the way India banks today üí™

In recent years, the RBI has continued to adapt ‚Äî enabling UPI‚Äôs rapid growth into a global payments benchmark, making onboarding simpler with Video KYC, and exploring the future of money through digital currency pilots. Its scale-based framework for NBFC regulation and the formation of the Monetary Policy Committee have further strengthened the system‚Äôs resilience.

Through changing times and new challenges, the RBI‚Äôs role has remained clear ‚Äî enabling progress while safeguarding stability
