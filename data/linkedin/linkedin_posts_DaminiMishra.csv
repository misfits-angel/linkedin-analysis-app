I get the skepticism. Models commoditize fast.
 But having shipped voice agents in hairy, real-world stacks and having clocked ~100k minutes selling everything from garbage bags and wood-pressed oils to mattresses and premium jewelry, I can say that this is what actually compounds:
- Deep vertical plumbing (CRMs, ERPs, order systems)
- Distribution loops (own a channel to activate use cases at scale)
- New UX patterns (voice where text/forms fail)
- Multiple workflows (customer lock-in by automating all possible workflows for them)
CX and loan collections are lucrative—but they’re early chapters. The bigger story is augmenting workflows that never had a voice at all.
Happy to compare notes if you’re building in a niche and thinking “is there a moat here?”
