Real Money Gaming  collapsed because no one asked the right questions while it was booming.

For years, this space grew with ambition, addiction and silence. Now everyone is suddenly outraged or relieved.

Instead of choosing sides: How did we build something so big, so fast, and so fragile?

Government - Collected 28% GST but why wait for an outrage to blanket ban it?
Dream11 logos on IPL jerseys? Where was the public education campaign (like Jago Grahak Jago)? Or an independent body to track social harm alongside (GST) economic data?

Industry (Builders + Investors)- Chasing CAC/LTV, and PAT. Did # of suicides or cost of ruined lives ever reached the deck? 
Is financial captivity the best engagement strategy? Could ""easy-money"" ads be more transparent? Did we have self-(moral)regulation like user caps, loss limits, or mandatory cool-off periods?

Society- Why do we keep falling for easy money illusions that monetize despair? 
Could we not see that this wasn't play but addiction by design, and we walked straight into it? 

This collapse was inevitable so is the reboot now.

People won't bet their life savings on fantasy apps anymore (probably find something new to get screwed). 

Here's how I think the industry will be set on a course of correction:

""Hope to Win"" → ""Joy of Play"" 
Free-to-play, social, and esports models will get a second wind. Gaming moves from being just a transaction to an experience again, rooted in fun, mastery, and community.

Studios → Creator-Led Economies 
Just like Insta and YouTube disrupted media — gaming is next. UGC-led platforms and interactive storytelling will unlock a new class of creators. Players won't just play. They'll design, remix, narrate, and co-build worlds.

Real Money → Real Rewards 
Forget jackpot coins, imagine unlocking Jordans you can actually wear. Games are moving toward real-world prizes: brand drops, merch rewards, and tangible perks. It's a win-win-win for players, builders, and brands alike.
Abhir Das 🔜 Gamescom at PlaySuper is doing some amazing stuff here. 

Edutainment is Coming for Real 
Game mechanics applied to skills, cognition, and growth. The winners here will design: flow-first, feedback-rich, and deeply replayable.

Capital Reset 
The best investors will recalibrate: not just for returns, but for resilience, regulation, and real user value. Sustainability and social alignment aren't trade-offs. They're the next compounding edge.

I'm sure Dream11, Mobile Premier League (MPL), Zupee & Rummy Circle will rise like phoenixes, but I'm curious to know how. Share your ideas.

Now try that with a game...and see how long it really takes.

That’s the paradox: Interactive content is inevitable, but creating it is still stuck in the past.

My previous post talks about how passive content is dying. But here’s why the revolution is stalled:
Creating fun is… not fun.

Every content format needs two things to succeed: creation and distribution.

Distribution is solving itself as social media platforms get into gaming (topic for another blog).

Creation? Still broken.

I spent a year talking to 200+ people across the gaming ecosystem….IGDC events, billion -dollar studios, gaming schools.
Here's what I found across every skill level:
- Beginners: Want to create, freeze on code requirements
- Intermediates: Have one or max two skills but not all, no budget, compete with studios
- Studios: Spend 4+ months, six figures for ""something playable""

But the real heartbreak? The next generation of game creators.

A student at India's top gaming school told me: ""I had 23 classmates in first year who wanted to make games. Only 4 of us made it to third year. The rest gave up when creativity became computer science.""

Students aren't delusional about being creative—the tools are. They enroll to be game makers, not software engineers. But that's exactly what the creation process demands.

The ""solutions"" aren't solving it.
No-code tools still require “tech-think” and Roblox gave us walled-garden creativity.

Despite all these tools, can you really create a game right now?

Here's the reality: 3.5 billion people play game. Only technical teams can make it.
Something has to break.

I've been building toward a fundamentally different approach. 
I'll share it soon.
How do you think this gets solved?

Do you actually remember any of it?
Yeah… didn’t think so.

We consume 8x more content than our parents but retain about 3x less. Something broke.

Why?
Because we didn’t evolve formats.
We kicked off a dopamine arms race with passive consumption. 

Watch the evolution driven purely by engagement:

1990s: Text-first platforms (blogs, forums) 
2004: Facebook launches with text status updates 
2010: Instagram goes image-first → 1B users 
2016: TikTok goes video-first → reshapes everything

And the same story, told today?
Text (0.1% engagement) → Image (0.3%) → Video (0.7%) → Bitsized video (2.5%)

Then came the panic pivots:
 - Instagram adds Reels 6 months after TikTok explodes
 - LinkedIn mimics TikTok, despite being “professional”
 - YouTube launches Shorts to keep up

Every leap in format = more stimulation.
And now? 
We're in full-blown jittery goldfish mode.

Because here’s the punchline: 
Engagement went up. Retention flatlined..

Twitch’s ""I'm Only Sleeping"" category (where literally streamers do nothing) logged over 4.1M hours watched in just the last 30 days.

My co-founder Sangrish Saigiridhar often codes with random YouTube videos quietly playing in the background. People binge 6+ hours a day but can’t even recall what they watched yesterday.

Meanwhile, brands are investing $247B in social media video ads last year. Yet, 45% of viewers watched less than a minute.

We're overstimulating dopamine receptors—creating consumption without comprehension.

Here’s the kicker:
- Attention spans dropped 25% during the video boom
- Video takes 5x the effort of text, gets consumed in ~8 second bites

David Foster Wallace saw this coming: ""The real question is how to stay alive while drowning in stimuli.""

So here’s my take:
The next breakout format? It won’t crank up the volume.
 It’ll solve engagement fatigue.

Some of the sharpest founders I know are already betting against passive consumption.

So let me ask: What do you think is the next big content format?

I've always questioned the effort-to-impact ratio in this endless digital noise, yet consumption has become our collective addiction:

-  An avg social media user scrolls through over 300 ft (~ height of Statue of Liberty) daily, while brands poured $276B into ads chasing those eyeballs last year

- There are 207 million active content creators today and 54% of businesses plan to boost content spend

Today's content battle is fought on two fronts: volume and authenticity.

Volume constraints are visibly falling — just as 150 years ago steam-powered looms multiplied cloth output 500x per worker, modern tools (from TikTok to OpenAI’s GPT) have dramatically compressed production time for blogs, images, and videos.

But here's the paradox that keeps me up: unlike factory goods, content thrives on subjectivity and for me, it is always about the highest wisdom-to-word ratio. MrBeast didn't rack up 83B views by standardization — he succeeded by being unapologetically original.

This brings us to one of the defining creative challenges of our time: How do you automate something that requires human originality?

It's not just a technical hurdle — it's a communication one. After millennia of struggling to express ourselves to other humans (just ask any relationship therapist 😅), we're now trying to brief machines with prompts and expect art in return.

Let's be honest — your best AI result isn't ""one prompt and done."" It's a dialogue. And often a time taking one.

As this relationship evolves, I wonder: will AI become more intuitive to our creative needs, or will we develop new muscles to converse with our digital collaborators? Chances are, both — through mutual adaptation.

So before the singularity arrives, what do you look for in an AI creative companion to swipe right? 👀
