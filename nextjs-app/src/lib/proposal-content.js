Visibility that expands your opportunity space.\n\n<span style='background-color: #d6e3dd; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; display: inline; line-height: 2;'>'Mind' has memory, recall, and the ability to connect the dots.</span>\n\nIt remembers key facts about you, your preferences, and your POVs from your calls with the brand managers, and from your voice notes. And your app activity. What you bookmark, agree with, or disagree with. It preserves the long-term context and becomes more like you over time. It updates itself after every call with your brand manager.\n\nUsing memory compression, Mind stores only what matters most.

        question: "My LinkedIn feed is just AI slop and cringe stories. Why would I want to add more junk to that pile?",
        answer: "You're not wrong. AI makes it easy to sound clever, but then everyone sounds the same. No personality. Just noise.\n\nBut LinkedIn is just a platform. It's how people use it. Most people are chasing visibility because it is measurable and it is quick. But it costs them their credibility.\n\n<span style='background-color: #d6e3dd; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; display: inline; line-height: 2;'>But if one can share thoughtful learnings, it builds credibility. Done consistently, it also builds visibility.</span> Gradually, and then suddenly. Like most things that compound.\n\nAlso, most decision-makers are on LinkedIn. This makes it a strong channel for B2B founders."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need you? Can I not do it myself?",
        answer: "Yes, you can do it yourself using LLMs. But <span style='background-color: #d6e3dd; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; display: inline; line-height: 2;'>DIY comes with hidden costs. Mostly time and focus.</span> And a bit of sanity. Because LLMs need to be reined in.\n\nEven if you start strong, something urgent will eventually take over, and a week will quietly slip away. And then more."
      },
      {
        question: "Why you? I can hire an intern.",
        answer: "You could hand it off to an intern.\nBut your brand voice might start sounding like a college assignment. And it'll still be your job.\n\nFounders juggle countless priorities. Product, distribution, fundraising, and five other fires every morning. <span style='background-color: #d6e3dd; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; display: inline; line-height: 2;'>What we do is take one of those spinning plates off your hands.</span>\n\nOver time, we build your second brain. <span style='background-color: #d6e3dd; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; display: inline; line-height: 2;'>You share your raw thoughts. We handle the grind.</span> We draft posts in your voice. And we do it consistently."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the rush?",
        answer: "<span style='background-color: #d6e3dd; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; display: inline; line-height: 2;'>Each day is like perishable inventory.</span> It carries its own opportunity cost.\nEach day your competition is building their distribution, strengthening their narrative.\nEach day they are moving ahead and compounding.\nAnd if you are not moving ahead too, you are falling behind."
      },
      {
        question: "How much time commitment is required from the user?",
        answer: "<span style='background-color: #d6e3dd; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; display: inline; line-height: 2;'>1-2 calls with the brand manager per month. And 5-10 mins on the app daily.</span> App time does not cost much as it comes from your idle time in between important stuff. So practically it is 1-2 hours per month. Final post approval time is not included as it depends upon how much time you want to invest.\n\nIn addition there is also a one-time investment of up to 3 hours initially to set expectations and establish brand positioning."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do you have a human in the loop?",
        answer: "<span style='background-color: #d6e3dd; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; display: inline; line-height: 2;'>We've learned that the best results come when AI and humans work together.</span> AI brings deep knowledge, memory, the ability to connect the dots, and tireless efficiency. Humans bring judgment, empathy, brand intuition, and strategic thinking.\n\nOur brand managers speak with customers to understand positioning. They review, edit and refine every draft to make sure it's meaningful and on-brand. In doing so, they also help train our models on you, building your unique Mind."
