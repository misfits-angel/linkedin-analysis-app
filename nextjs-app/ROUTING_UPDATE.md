# Routing Update Documentation

## Overview
The application routing has been restructured to better organize the user experience and separate the public-facing homepage from the authenticated login/dashboard area.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Homepage (`/`)
- **Location**: `src/app/page.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Landing page that displays the Unstoppable logo and automatically redirects to the main website
- **Features**:
  - Shows Unstoppable logo with pulse animation
  - Automatically redirects to `https://theunstoppable.ai/` after 2 seconds
  - Provides manual navigation links:
    - Link to main website (`https://theunstoppable.ai/`)
    - Link to login page (`/login`)

### 2. Login/Dashboard Page (`/login`)
- **Location**: `src/app/login/page.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Authentication and main dashboard for analyzing LinkedIn data
- **Features**:
  - Protected route requiring authentication
  - File upload for LinkedIn CSV data
  - Admin control section for managing profiles
  - LinkedIn analytics visualization
  - Shareable report generation

### 3. Shareable Reports (`/[token]`)
- **Location**: `src/app/[token]/page.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Public-facing shareable reports
- **Features**:
  - No authentication required
  - Dynamic token-based routing
  - Server-side data fetching
  - Clean, branded report view

## URL Structure

```
https://users.theunstoppable.ai/
├── /                          → Home page (redirects to main website)
├── /login                     → Login & Dashboard (requires auth)
└── /[token]                   → Shareable reports (public)
```

## Authentication Flow

1. User visits `https://users.theunstoppable.ai/`
2. Homepage shows Unstoppable logo
3. Auto-redirects to main website OR user clicks "Go to Login"
4. `/login` page checks authentication
5. If not authenticated, shows login form with Google OAuth
6. If authenticated, shows dashboard

## Benefits

- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Better user experience with branded landing page
- ✅ Professional redirect to main website
- ✅ Maintains existing shareable report functionality
- ✅ Clear authentication boundaries
- ✅ Easy to maintain and extend

## Development Notes

- All existing functionality has been preserved
- No breaking changes to API routes
- Shareable report URLs remain unchanged
- Authentication logic remains in `ProtectedRoute` component

## Testing

1. **Homepage**: Visit `/` → Should show logo and redirect
2. **Login**: Visit `/login` → Should show login if not authenticated
3. **Dashboard**: After login → Should show full dashboard
4. **Reports**: Visit `/{any-valid-token}` → Should show report

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Add more branding to homepage
- Implement custom redirect delay setting
- Add analytics tracking for homepage visits
- Create a public about/info page
